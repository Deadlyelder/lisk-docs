The steps that are necessary and/or recommended for updating the documentation to a new version are explained on this page.

== Explaining by example: Releasing the SDK 4.0.0 docs

This guide uses the release of the SDK 4.0.0 docs as an example to illustrate the general steps that need to be done for a new release on a practical level.
Lisk SDK version 3.0.2 is the previous latest version in this example.

NOTE: The steps explained here are not specific for the Lisk SDK docs and do also apply for other documentation components like `core`, `protocol` and `service`.

== Preparing the new docs


=== Learning

Examples how to get knowledge about the new release:

* Get onboarded internally (if provided)
** via internal changelog
** via STMs
* Get onboarded on GitHub in the project description: https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk/projects
** Read all LIPs carefully, which are linked in the project description
+

* Check the corresponding GitHub project: https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk/projects/76
** Look at the epic issues
** Go down to the child issues and PRs of certain epics of needed

=== Setting up a new project in the lisk-docs repository

. Create a new project on lisk-docs for the new version: https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-docs/projects
* title: "Lisk SDK 4.0.0"
* description: follow the existing examples
//TODO: Create a section about creating issues in the styleguide
. xref:{}[Create issues] for all upcoming content changes in the docs and add them to the project.
New issues can still be added later, if necessary.

==== Major release

If a major version is released, a new content branch needs to be created for it.

Create a new branch `docs-sdk-3.0.2`, on the base of `docs-sdk`.
Like the version number indicates, this branch will store the docs that become outdated with the new release.

.lisk-docs/
[source,bash]
----
git checkout docs-sdk
git checkout -b docs-sdk-3.0.2
----

The branch `docs-sdk` will be used as base for the new documentation.
All issues created for the new version will be merged into this new branch.

To do so, bump the `version` in `antora.yml`:

.On branch `docs-sdk`
[source,yaml]
----
name: lisk-sdk
title: Lisk SDK
version: '4.0.0' <1>
display_version: '4.0.0' <2>
start_page: ROOT:index.adoc
nav:
- modules/ROOT/nav.adoc
----

<1> Bump to the latest version
<2> Change from `master` to the new version.
This will be changed back to `master` as one of the last steps before the new docs release.



== Content creation

The recommended order of updating the SDK docs is as follows:

=== References
==== Update API specification
//TODO: Add section about building the api spec with `swagger2markup`
==== Update Config reference
==== Update Lisk Commander reference
==== Update Lisk Elements reference
==== Update Lisk Framework reference

=== Explanations
