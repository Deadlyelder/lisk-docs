== Creating issues

== Working on an issue

. To work on an issue, first assign yourself to it.
. Then check out `docs-sdk` and create a new branch named after the issue you are working on:
+
[source,bash]
----
git checkout docs-sdk
git checkout -b 123-issue-title
----
+
where `123` should be the corresponding issue number.
. Now commit the intended changes and push them back to the `lisk-docs` repository on Github:
+
[source,bash]
----
git push origin 123-issue-title
----


== Creating a PR (pull request)

. On Github, now open a PR with `docs-sdk` as base branch, add the PR to the project created in section <<preparing, Preparing the release>>.
Then link the corresponding issue in the description and request a reviewer.
