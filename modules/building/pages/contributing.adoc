** Use template `Feature` for further ideas how to improve the documentation (e.g. structure changes of content or adding additional content).
** Use template `Update` content that is outdated.
* Title: Choose a self-explaining, clear title
* Description:
** Provide a detailed description of the issue.
** Mention which components and versions are affected by the issue.

=== Epics and child issues

An epic issue is an issue that needs several PRs to be solved.

.Example of an epic issue
[source,markdown]
----
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The content about the documentation strategy is all in one document which doesn't give a good overview about all its contents.
Furthermore, some of the needed content is outdated or not existent yet.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A new documentation component `docs-manual` should be created. This component will contain 2 new modules:
- A new documentation module `styleguide` should contain all guidelines and best practices regarding the style of writing in the Lisk documentation.
- A new documentation module `build` should contain all steps and guidelines about how the content of the docs is structured prepared for production.

- [ ] Add new documentation module `styleguide` <1>
- [ ] Add new documentation module `build` #754 <2>
----
<1> Break the epic issue down into child issues, and list the tasks below the description of the epic issue.
<2> If a child issue was already created, refer to the issue ID.

=== Working on an issue

. To work on an issue, first assign yourself to it.
. Then check out the base branch, here `docs-sdk`, and create a new branch named after the issue you are working on:
+
[source,bash]
----
git checkout docs-sdk
git checkout -b 123-issue-title
----
+
where `123` should be the corresponding issue number.
. Start to make your changes and commit them.
. Then push them back to the `lisk-docs` repository on GitHub:
+
[source,bash]
----
git push origin 123-issue-title
