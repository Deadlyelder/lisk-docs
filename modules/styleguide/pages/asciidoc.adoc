Always start with a H0 heading (a single `=`)

<3> Add all desired asciidoc attributes for this document below.
<4> Add all external URLs used in this document below.

== Links
Always set link attributes, to simplify the management of links.
Order the link attributes alphabetically

TIP: Please read the guide about {url_asciidoctor_best_practices}[link attributes in Asciidoc].

Naming convention for link attributes:

* Always start with the prefix ‘url’
* Use an underscore ‘_’ as the separator between words
* Describe a link with as few words as possible
* Be consistent and use same names for same links, and similar names for similar links

Examples:
[source,asciidoc]
----
:url_github_core: https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-core

:url_guides_config_default_values: lisk-sdk/guides/configuration.html#modify_default_values

For more information, see the {url_antora_link_syntax}[Navigation Link Syntax, Content, and Styles^] chapter of the Antora documentation.

Please also refer to the xref:{url_index_links}[Lisk docs link styleguide].

=== Anchor links
Anchor links
Anchor IDs are automatically generated from the page title.

.Title
[source,asciidoc]
----
= Some title
----

Resulting anchor ID: `some-title`

==== How to link to the ID from the same page

We'll walk through a <<some-title,detailed example>> in this tutorial.

==== How to link to the ID from different page

Set a link attribute

 :url_anotherpage_foobar: another-page.adoc#some-title

Use the link attribute in the content

 xref:{url_anotherpage_foobar}[An in-module page anchor link]

==== How to create a custom anchor ID
Titles can change and therefore anchor links break easily
Sometimes it can be useful to set a custom anchor ID:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[[foobar]]
== Some title

It is also possible to place inline anchor point, for example [[foobar2]]here
----

=== Internal links
Internal links are relative links starting from the ‘pages’ folder of each content branch.

Set as link attributes:

:url_index: index.adoc
:url_topic_page: topic/page.adoc
:url_component_page: other-component::page.adoc

How to set internal link in the content:

[source,asciidoc]
----
xref:{url_index}[In-module page]
xref:{url_topic_page}[In-module page in a topic folder]
xref:{url_component_page}[Page in another component]
----

=== External links
Add external link icons to every external link.
Open external links in a new tab by appending `^` to the link title.

How to define an external link attribute:

 :url_github_core: https://other-website.com/url

How to place the external link in the content:

 {url_github_core}[Link to another website^]

== Other page attributes

Add a meta description HTML tag to the page.

 :description: The Lisk SDK Setup page describes...

Add a table of contents.

 :toc:

[NOTE]
====
The table of content is intentionally not visible in the Antora generated docs, as Antora generates a separate toc out of the content.
It still makes sense to include it, to render the table of contents on other occasions, like on GitHub.
====

Set custom Next and Previous links to the end of a page:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:page-previous: /lisk-sdk/index.html
:page-previous-title: Overview
:page-next-title: Getting Started
:page-next: /lisk-sdk/getting-started.html
----

Don’t show Next or Previous links at the end of a page.

[source,asciidoc]
----
:page-no-previous: true
:page-no-next: true
----

== Line breaks
Use for every new sentence a new line, never write multiple sentences into one line.
Asciidoctor will still render the text as one paragraph, it’s being done to keep a better overview while writing.

To start a new paragraph use 2 new lines.

[source,asciidoc]
----
Use for each sentence one line.
This help to get a better overview about the content.
These three sentences will all be part of the same paragraph.

This line will belong to a new paragraph.
----

Avoid line breaks if possible, but if you really need to do it, add a `+` at the end of the line.

[source,asciidoc]
----
This is one line, +
And here starts a new line!
----

== Capitalization

* Use capital letters for product names
* Don't capitalize words in a heading which you wouldn't capitalize in a normal sentence.
* ID is always written all upper case (except in variable names).
* Transaction types are always written all lowercase (Except in variable names, e.g. `RegisterDelegateTransaction`), e.g.:
+
> In DPoS systems, each account that has enough balance to send a delegate registration transaction and hasn’t done so before, can register a new delegate on the network.

== Images

Images are saved in the `modules/ROOT/assets/images` folder.

If you include an image on a page, set the following attribute, to make sure it will be displayed in your editor preview and on GitHub.

 :imagesdir: ../assets/images

The `imagesdir` path needs to be always relative to the location of the current page.

After placing the `imagesdir` attribute, insert an image by referring to its file name.

 image:banner_sdk.png[Logo]

== Admonitions

Use Admonitions to highlight important statements for the user.
[source,asciidoc]
----
NOTE: General information to highlight
TIP: To explain short cuts, best practices, optional tips
IMPORTANT: Highlight important content, that the user should not miss
CAUTION: Highlight content, where the user has to be careful
WARNING: Warn users about bad consequences that can happen
----

CAUTION: Highlight content, where the user has to be careful

WARNING: Warn users about bad consequences that can happen

== Headings

Use the following heading levels, never skip heading levels on a page and always use only one H0 title. Titles are being written in sentence case, i.e. small letters except for the first letter of the first word, names or abbreviations.

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Title
== Subtitle
=== Sub-subtitle
== 2nd subtitle
----

== Monospace
The font `Monospace` should be used in following cases:

* Variables
* File names
* Small code snippets

//@TODO: create new page for terminology, or refer to company temrinology guide.
== Terminology

Covering which terms to use and their capitalization.
