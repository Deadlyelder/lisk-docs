=== Node.js

https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] serves as the underlying engine for code execution.
There are several different ways and version managers to install Node.JS on your system.
We recommend one of the following two:

[IMPORTANT]
====
Change to the `lisk` to install Node.js:
[source,bash]
----
sudo -u lisk -i
----

Option A - Node Version Manager::

We recommend using a Node version manager such as https://github.com/creationix/nvm[NVM].
NVM is a bash script that enables you to manage multiple active Node.js versions.

. Install nvm following these https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install--update-script[instructions]
. Install the correct version of Node.js using NVM:

[source,bash]
----
nvm install 10.15.3
----
--
Option B - Node.js package::

--
If you do not want to use NVM or other package managers, you can install the Node package globally on your system alternatively:

*Ubuntu*

[source,bash]
----
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
----

*MacOS*

[source,bash]
----
brew install node@10.15.3
