=== Ports


[IMPORTANT]
====
*Mandatory:* Always open the *WebSocket* port of your desired network to enable communication with other peer nodes.

*Optional:* Open the corresponding HTTP port for your network in order to ensure your nodeâ€™s xref:reference/api.adoc[API] is reachable.
For more information, see the diagram on the xref:interact-with-the-api.adoc[Interact with network] page.
====

To connect to the desired network with Lisk Core, please ensure that the corresponding ports listed below are open:

[options="header",]
|===
|Network |HTTP |WebSocket
|Mainnet |8000 |8001
|Testnet |7000 |7001
|Betanet |5000 |5001
|Devnet |4000 |5000
|===

These are the default ports for connecting with the network.
They can be altered later in the xref:management/configuration.adoc[`config.json`] file.
