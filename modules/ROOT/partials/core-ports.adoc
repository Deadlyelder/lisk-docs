=== Ports

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Mandatory:* Always open the *WebSocket* port of your desired network, to enable communication with other peer nodes.

*Optional:* Open the corresponding HTTP port for your network, to make your nodeâ€™s https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/api[API] reachable.
For more information, see the diagram on the xref:getting-started/interact-with-network.adoc[Interact with network] page.
====

To connect to the desired network with Lisk Core, please ensure that the corresponding ports listed below are open:

[options="header",]
|===
|Network |HTTP |WebSocket
|Mainnet |8000 |8001
|Testnet |7000 |7001
|Devnet |4000 |5000
|===

These are the default ports for connecting with the network.
They can be xref:configuration.adoc[altered] later in the xref:configuration.adoc#_structure[`config.json`] file.
