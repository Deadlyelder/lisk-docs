To upgrade Lisk Core from Binary please follow the instructions below.
Please choose the instructions specific to the network (Mainnet or Testnet) your node is connected to.

== Upgrade with Lisk Commander

IMPORTANT: The `core:upgrade` command is only supported for Lisk Core versions > `2.0.0` and will only work, if Lisk Core has been installed with Lisk Commander before.

First, go into the directory, where your Lisk Core installation is located.

Then, run the following command to upgrade Lisk Core:

[source,bash]
----
lisk core:upgrade <location>
----

Where `<location>` should be the root folder of your Lisk Core installation.

See for all available options the Lisk Commander xref:{v_sdk}@lisk-sdk::lisk-commander/user-guide/lisk-core.adoc[Command reference for Lisk Core] as well as the xref:{v_sdk}@lisk-sdk::lisk-commander/user-guide/commands.adoc[general Command reference] .

== Upgrade with bash script

[source,bash]
----
cd ~
rm -f installLisk.sh
