Lisk Service is a web application that allows interaction with various blockchain networks based on Lisk and Bitcoin protocols.
Its main principle is to provide services that are complementary to the main blockchain product Lisk Core.

The main focus of this project is to provide data to the UI clients such as Lisk Desktop and Lisk Mobile.
Lisk Service makes it possible to access all live blockchain data in a similar way to the regular Lisk Core API, but also provides users with much more details, such as geolocation and various statistics about network usage.

The project implementation is based on microservices.
The technical stack is designed to deliver several microservices and each of them is meant to provide one particular functionality such as Lisk blockchain support.
The data is served in JSON format and exposed by a public RESTful API.
