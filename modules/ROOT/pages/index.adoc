The {url_github_sdk}[Lisk SDK^] is an open-source software development kit which enables developers to create modular blockchain applications.

The modular architecture of the Lisk SDK allows to configure, exchange or extent any of the blockchain related logic in the application, allowing to create the blockchain and the application around it with exactly the characteristics you desire.
This is achieved by simply registering new modules and plugins with the application.

Blockchain applications built with the Lisk SDK allow a much bigger variety of use cases compared to smart contract platforms.
That's because each blockchain application is running its own custom blockchain, which can be optimized for the specific use case.
In result, the logic executed in a blockchain application can be much more complex compared to the logic that can be executed as part of a smart contract.

All complex and general parts of creating blockchain applications are taken care of by the Lisk SDK.
The application interfaces are designed to only expose the relevant development steps to the developer.

In other words, the Lisk SDK provides you with a tasty pot of spicy blockchain potpourri, and a full kitchen around it to help you make it *your* potpourri - or blockchain application. As you prefer.

The codebase is written entirely in JavaScript and TypeScript, using {url_nodejs}[Node.js^] as underlying engine for code execution.
So developers familiar with JavaScript and/or TypeScript don't need to learn any new language and can start building their apps directly in the programming language they are most familiar with.

.Interoperability of blockchain applications
[NOTE]
====
In version 5 of the Lisk SDK, every blockchain application is a completely independent blockchain application.

In version 6 of the Lisk SDK, which will be released soon, these blockchain application will be able to connect to the Lisk Mainchain, which will make them sidechains.

Sidechains will be interoperable with each other and the Lisk Mainchain, which will introduce many new interesting use cases to develop services like oracles or prediction markets.
After the implementation of interoperability, all of the most important features of the Lisk SDK will be implemenged.
====

== Quickstart

=== Dependencies

The following dependencies need to be installed to run the Lisk SDK:

[options="header",]
|===
|Dependencies |Version
|Node.js | v12 (latest)
|===

=== Installation

Create a `package.json` file.

[source,bash]
----
npm init --yes
----

The installation of the Lisk SDK only requires getting a single NPM package `lisk-sdk`, to your Node.js project.

[source,bash]
----
npm install lisk-sdk
----

=== Create the application

Create a new file `index.js` and paste the snippet below.

[NOTE]
====
The `lisk-sdk` package contains the sample objects `genesisBlockDevnet` and `configDevnet` which enable the user to quickly spin up a development blockchain network.
`genesisBlockDevnet` includes a set of preconfigured genesis delegates, that will immediately start forging on a single node to stabilize the network.
`configDevnet` includes the configuration for the Devnet.

Both objects can be customized before passing them to the `Application` instance, if desired.
====

[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet } = require('lisk-sdk'); <1>

const app = Application.defaultApplication(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); <2>

app <3>
	.run()
	.then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
	.catch(error => {
		console.error('Faced error in application', error);
		process.exit(1);
	});
----

<1> Import the `Application`, `genesisBlockDevnet` and `configDevnet` from the `lisk-sdk` package.
<2> Creates a default application, which comes with all default modules.
<3> Starts the application.

=== Start the application

After saving the file with the above contents, start the application in the terminal as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
node index.js
----

To verify the application start, check the log messages in the terminal.
If the start was successful, the application will enable forging for all genesis delegates and will start to add new blocks to the blockchain every 10 seconds.

[NOTE]
====
After completing these steps, the default blockchain application of the Lisk SDK will now be running.

It is now possible to customize your application by registering new xref:{}[modules] and xref:{}[plugins], and also adjusting the genesis block and config to suit your specific use case.

== Getting started

To get started with the Lisk SDK and the development of a blockchain application, please refer to the following sections in the documentation:

=== Quickstart

The quickest way to bootstrap a blockchain application with the Lisk SDK is described on the xref:{url_quickstart}[] page.

=== Tutorials

The xref:{url_tutorials}[Tutorials] explain in detail how to build a specific blockchain application.
All examples provided in the tutorials describe how to implement simple, but valid industry use cases.

The tutorials overview page provides an informative overview about all existing tutorials, including the estimated time and the skill level required to complete each specific tutorial.

TIP: All code for the example apps that is used in the tutorials is also available in the {url_github_sdk_examples}[lisk-sdk-examples repository^] on GitHub.

=== The Lisk protocol

The xref:{url_protocol}[Lisk protocol] is the set of rules followed by a blockchain created with the Lisk SDK using the default configuration.
It contains various development-agnostic specifications about the Lisk SDK.

It is a good location to look up certain topics in order to gain a deeper understanding, or to further explore the SDK in a scientific direction.

=== Architecture

The architecture pages contain various explanations about the architecture of the Lisk Framework.

It contains the following chapters:

* xref:{url_framework}[]
** xref:{url_explanations_onchain}[]
** xref:{url_explanations_offchain}[]
** xref:{url_explanations_communication}[]

=== How-To Guides

The development guides are dedicated how-to guides which cover specific topics required to build a blockchain application with the Lisk SDK.

The most relevant guides for beginners are:

* xref:{url_guides_setup}[]
* xref:{url_guides_config}[]
* xref:{url_guides_module}[]
* xref:{url_guides_asset}[]
* xref:{url_guides_frontend}[]
