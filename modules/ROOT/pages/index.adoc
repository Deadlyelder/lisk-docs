== What is the Lisk SDK?

The {url_github_sdk}[Lisk SDK^] is an open-source software development kit which enables developers to create modular blockchain applications.

The modular architecture of the Lisk SDK allows to configure, exchange or extent any of the blockchain related logic in the application, enabling developers to create the blockchain application with exactly the characteristics they desire.
This is achieved by simply registering new modules and plugins with the application.

The codebase is written entirely in JavaScript and TypeScript, using {url_nodejs}[Node.js^] as underlying engine for code execution.
So developers familiar with JavaScript and/or TypeScript don't need to learn any new language and can start building their apps directly in the programming language they are most familiar with.

=== Comparison to smart contract applications

Blockchain applications built with the Lisk SDK allow a much bigger variety of use cases compared to smart contract platforms.
That's because each blockchain application is running its own custom blockchain, which can be optimized for the specific use case.

In smart contract applications, all contracts are stored on the same blockchain, for example the Ethereum blockchain.
This can cause problems because the smart contract applications need to share the same resource.
One benefit of sidechains in contrast to smart contracts applications is, that issues on one sidechain, for example related to performance or security, will never effect the other sidechains, because each sidechain is maintaining their own blockchain network.

For example, if the traffic on one sidechain is very high, and in result the transaction fees in the network rise, the transaction fees on the other sidechains or the Lisk Mainchain wont be affected by this.
In addition, the logic executed in a blockchain application can be much more complex compared to the logic that can be executed as part of a smart contract.

== Quickstart

The quickest way to bootstrap a blockchain application with the Lisk SDK is explained here.

=== Dependencies

The following dependencies need to be installed to run the Lisk SDK:

==== Node.js

[options="header",]
|===
|Dependencies |Version
|Node.js | v12 (latest)
|===

If you are using NVM, ensure you install the correct version as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
nvm install v12.22.1
----

==== Lisk Commander

It is recommended to install Lisk Commander globally with NPM to facilitate the convenient usage of the Lisk Commander CLI.

[source,bash]
----
npm install --global --production lisk-commander
----

=== Project setup

[source,bash]
----
mkdir new_app
cd new_app
----

./new_app/
[source,bash]
----
lisk init
----

The user is asked for the application name, description, author, and license after running `lisk init`.

Next, all the required files are created by Lisk Commander.

NOTE: The application CLI offers various commands to conveniently manage your blockchain application.

As shown in the snippet above, a new folder `src/commands/` will be created, which contains all files for the available command-line commands of the application.

To see an overview of all the available CLI commands, execute the following in the root folder of the application:

./new_app/
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run
----

=== Start the application

Execute the following command to start the blockchain application.

./new_app/
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run start
----

To verify that the application has started, check the log messages in the terminal.
If the start was successful, the application will enable forging for all genesis delegates and will start to add new blocks to the blockchain every 10 seconds.

//TODO: Create updated gif with the new command
//image:node-start.gif[]

[NOTE]
====
After completing these steps, the default blockchain application of the Lisk SDK will now be running.

It is now possible to customize your application by registering new modules and plugins, and also adjusting the genesis block and config to suit your specific use case.

More information can be found in the following guides:
