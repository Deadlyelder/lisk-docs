.What is the Lisk SDK?
****
The Lisk SDK is an open-source software development kit which enables developers to build scalable xref:{url_blockchain_apps}[] in JavaScript.
****

== Features

The most important features of the Lisk SDK:

* **One blockchain per app**: xref:{url_blockchain_apps}[] each run on their own customized blockchain.
* Programming language: **JavaScript/Typescript**
* Consensus algorithm: *xref:{url_protocol_dpos}[Lisk DPoS] & xref:{url_protocol_bft}[Lisk BFT]*
* Completely modular: Configure, exchange or extent any of the blockchain related logic in the application with *xref:{url_introduction_modules}[] and xref:{url_introduction_plugins}[]*.
* *Convenient development tools*:
** xref:{url_references_commander}[Lisk Commander]:
*** Bootstrap a complete default blockchain application with only 1 command.
*** Generate skeletons for modules, assets and plugins.
*** Use the Lisk SDK libraries in the terminal via the Lisk console REPL.
*** Many other convenient CLI tools like creating accounts, encrypting passphrases / messages and more.
** xref:{url_references_dashboard_plugin}[]: Communicate conveniently with your blockchain application during development via a dashboard.
** xref:{url_references_test_suite}[SDK test suite]: simplifies to test all components of a blockchain application by providing dedicated fixtures, mocks and utility functions.
* Connect to the Lisk Ecosystem (coming {url_lisk_roadmap}[soon^]): Make your app interoperable with other blockchain applications, by registering it as sidechain on the Lisk Mainchain.

== Quickstart

The quickest way to bootstrap a blockchain application with the Lisk SDK is explained here.

=== Supported Operating Systems

The Lisk SDK will run on both the Ubuntu and MacOS operating systems shown below:

[tabs]

=====
Ubuntu::
+
--
* 18.04 (LTS)
* 20.04 (LTS)
--
MacOS::
+
--
* 10.13 (High Sierra)
* 10.14 (Mojave)
* 10.15 (Catalina)
* 11.04 (Big Sur)
--
=====

NOTE: Please note that the SDK does not run on the MS Windows operating systems.

=== Dependencies

The following dependencies need to be installed to run the Lisk SDK:

[options="header",]
|===
|Dependencies |Version
|Node.js | v12 (latest)
|Lisk Commander | v5.1.2 (latest)
|===

==== Node.js

If you are using NVM, ensure you install the correct version as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
nvm install v12.22.1
----

==== Lisk Commander

It is recommended to install Lisk Commander globally with NPM to facilitate the convenient usage of the Lisk Commander CLI.

[source,bash]
----
npm install --global lisk-commander
----

=== Project setup

[source,bash]
----
mkdir new_app
cd new_app
----

./new_app/
[source,bash]
----
lisk init
----

The user is asked for the application name, description, author, and license after running `lisk init`.

Next, all the required files are created by Lisk Commander.
----
Using template "lisk-ts"
Initializing git repository
Updating .liskrc.json file
Creating project structure
? Application name new_app
? Application description My blockchain application
? Author mona
? License ISC

----

=== Installing the app globally with npm

To use the application commands globally, it is required to install the dependencies globally:

./new_app/
[source,bash]
----
npm i -g
----

=== Start the application

Execute the following command to start the blockchain application.

./new_app/
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run start # <1>
# or
new_app start # <2>
----

<1> Starts the app
<2> Global command to start the application, if it was <<installing-the-app-globally-with-npm,installed globally>>.

To verify that the application has started, check the log messages in the terminal.
If the start was successful, the application will enable forging for all genesis delegates and will start to add new blocks to the blockchain every 10 seconds.

//TODO: Create updated gif with the new command
//image:node-start.gif[]

NOTE: The application CLI offers various commands to conveniently manage your blockchain application.

To see an overview of all the available CLI commands, execute the following in the root folder of the application:

./new_app/
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run --help
# or
new_app --help
----

.Next steps
****
After completing these steps, the default blockchain application of the Lisk SDK will now be running.

It is now possible to customize your application by registering new modules and plugins, and also adjusting the genesis block and config to suit your specific use case.

////
== Getting started

To get started with the Lisk SDK and the development of a blockchain application, please refer to the following sections in the documentation:

=== Quickstart

The quickest way to bootstrap a blockchain application with the Lisk SDK is described on the xref:{url_quickstart}[] page.

=== Tutorials

The xref:{url_tutorials}[Tutorials] explain in detail how to build a specific blockchain application.
All examples provided in the tutorials describe how to implement simple, but valid industry use cases.

The tutorials overview page provides an informative overview about all existing tutorials, including the estimated time and the skill level required to complete each specific tutorial.

TIP: All code for the example apps that is used in the tutorials is also available in the {url_github_sdk_examples}[lisk-sdk-examples repository^] on GitHub.

=== The Lisk protocol

The xref:{url_protocol}[Lisk protocol] is the set of rules followed by a blockchain created with the Lisk SDK using the default configuration.
It contains various development-agnostic specifications about the Lisk SDK.

It is a good location to look up certain topics in order to gain a deeper understanding, or to further explore the SDK in a scientific direction.

=== Architecture

The architecture pages contain various explanations about the architecture of the Lisk Framework.

It contains the following chapters:

* xref:{url_framework}[]
** xref:{url_introduction_modules}[]
** xref:{url_introduction_plugins}[]
** xref:{url_explanations_communication}[]

=== How-To Guides

The development guides are dedicated how-to guides which cover specific topics required to build a blockchain application with the Lisk SDK.

The most relevant guides for beginners are:

* xref:{url_guides_setup}[]
* xref:{url_guides_config}[]
* xref:{url_guides_module}[]
* xref:{url_guides_asset}[]
* xref:{url_guides_frontend}[]
