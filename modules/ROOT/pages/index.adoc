Lisk Core is the program that actually implements the Lisk Protocol.
In order to run a node which will participate in the network, the Lisk Core must be installed.
Furthermore, this also applies to every additional machine that is required to run a node.

Setting up Lisk Core provides the user with the following options:

* The ability to connect to a <<networks, Network>> and communicate with other nodes in the network.
* To have full control to xref:{url_config}[configure] Lisk Core to specific and custom requirements.
* To create your own <<snapshots, Snapshot>> of the blockchain.
* To use Lisk Core to perform actions on the Lisk blockchain, e.g. with {url_lisk_desktop}[Lisk Desktop^].
* To xref:{url_config_forging}[Forge] new blocks, (for active delegates).

[NOTE]
====
An instance of Lisk Core and a Lisk peer can generally be defined by the following two statements below:

A Lisk Core instance connected to a network is referred to as a Lisk *node*.

A Lisk node connected to other Lisk nodes, and is referred to as a Lisk *peer*.

Both statements above refer to a machine which in turn now becomes a server, after Lisk Core has been installed and executed.
Subsequently, the server now participates in the network and provides the blockchain data to it's clients.

== Getting started

[[node]]
=== What is a node?

The Lisk blockchain is a decentralized network that consists of many different servers, (or nodes).
Node operators are required to set up Lisk Core on a server, and then connect it to the desired network.

There are over 600 nodes around the world that are maintained by individuals, and these nodes communicate with the network.
For example, by broadcasting and receiving blocks or transactions from their peers.
In addition, Lisk nodes are also required to forge/add new blocks to the blockchain.
It is possible to view the live network statistics by accessing the following URL: {url_explorer}[Lisk’s Blockchain Explorer^].

=== Who should operate a node?

If you fall under one of the following categories listed below, then it is recommended to set up your own node:

* *Exchanges* and other services that rely on a stable API interface to the network.
* *Delegates* who wish to actively forge.
* *Users* who do not trust external sources and want to be in full control over their node.

=== Why operate a node?

There are several advantages listed below as to why one would wish to set up a node:

- To have your xref:{url_config_api}[private] entry point to communicate with the network.
This is especially important when running an exchange and implementing LSK tokens.
- To acquire full control in order to xref:{url_config}[configure] the node to your specific requirements.
- To create your own <<snapshots,Snapshots>> of the blockchain.
- To have the option to xref:{url_config_forging}[forge] new blocks, (assuming you are an active xref:{url_config_forging}[delegate]).

NOTE: To learn how to set up a node, please see xref:{url_getting_started}[Getting Started]

[[networks]]
== Networks

The Lisk Core can be connected to different networks.
Please be aware that there are three key accessible public networks existing which are entirely independent of each other.
These networks are described below.

[cols=3*,options="header"]
|===

| Name | Identifier  | Explorer

| Mainnet | none | {url_explorer}[Lisk Explorer^]

| Testnet | none | {url_explorer_testnet}[Lisk Testnet Explorer^]

| Betanet | `7158c297294a540bc9ac6e474529c3da38d03ece056e3fa2d98141e6ec54132d` | {url_explorer_betanet}[Lisk Betanet Explorer^]

|===

=== Mainnet

The Mainnet is where the true Lisk economy exists.
Within this network the Lisk users can transfer LSK tokens from one account to another, register accounts as delegates; and vote for other delegates.

=== Testnet

The Testnet is an independent replica of the Lisk Mainnet, whose main function is to test the upgrades first before they are run on the Lisk Mainnet.
Subsequently, this is where new/updated versions and fixes of the Lisk Core are tested.

To start using the Testnet, please download your free LSK Testnet from the {url_faucet_testnet}[Testnet Faucet^].

To connect to the Testnet via {url_lisk_desktop}[Lisk Desktop^], simply enable the "Network Switcher" in the settings and then use it to switch the network to `Testnet`.

=== Betanet

The Betanet is the place where the most recent releases of Lisk Core are tested, before moving to Testnet and Mainnet.

The releases for Lisk Core 3.0 will all be published on the Betanet.
Each version that uses a new major version of the Lisk SDK will result in a new hard fork in the network.
After the new releases have been released on Betanet gradually, they will be released on Testnet and later Mainnet eventually, to reduce the number of hard forks in the networks.

Read this Blog post for more information about the {url_log_core_schedule}[New Lisk Core release schedule^].

To start using the Betanet, please get your free Betanet LSK from the {url_faucet_betanet}[Betanet Faucet^]

To connect to the Betanet via {url_lisk_desktop}[Lisk Desktop^], simply enable the "Network Switcher" in the settings.
On the Login page, now enter `betanet.lisk.io` as custom node.



[[snapshots]]
== Snapshots

A snapshot is a backup of the complete blockchain.
It can be used to speed up the sync process, instead of having to validate all transactions starting from the genesis block to the current block height.
Lisk provides official snapshots of the blockchain which can be found in the following link: {url_lisk_snapshots}[http://snapshots.lisk.io^]

How to rebuild from a snapshot and to create your own snapshots, is explained in the administration section for each <<distributions, distribution>> of the Lisk Core.

TIP: It is recommended to use xref:{url_admin_binary_snapshot}[Lisk Core application] for creating your own snapshots, as a script is provided to conveniently create snapshots.

== Technology stack

The Lisk Core consists of the following 4 main technologies:

[tabs]
====
Node.JS::
+
--
{url_nodejs}[image:nodejs.png[Node.js,title="Node.js"]^]

{url_nodejs}[Node.js^] serves as the underlying engine for code execution in the Lisk Core.
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment, that executes the JavaScript code server-side.
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
--
Swagger::
+
--
{url_swagger}[image:swagger-logo.png[Swagger,title="Swagger"]^]

{url_swagger}[Swagger^] is an open source software framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful Web services.
As part of the Lisk Core documentation, the whole API specification can be explored interactively via the Swagger-UI interface.
--
PostgreSQL::
+
--
{url_postgresql}[image:postgresql.png[PostgreSQL,title="PostgreSQL"]^]

{url_postgresql}[PostgreSQL^] is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development.
It has subsequently earned a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
All Information on the Lisk mainchain is stored inside of the PostgreSQL databases.
--
Redis::
+
--
{url_redis}[image:redis.png[Redis,title="Redis"]^]

{url_redis}[Redis^] is an open source, in-memory data structure store.
Lisk Core mainly uses it to cache API responses.
This prevents performance drops in the application.
For example, when the same API request is sent repeatedly.
--
====

== Versioning schemes

Lisk Core is described in 2 different versioning schemes.
The *Software Implementation Version* and the *Protocol Version* as described below:

=== Software implementation versioning

All Lisk Core software changes except for the logging system, are communicated following the exact rules specified by the {url_semver}[SemVer^].

Software implementation versioning has a version prefix `v` followed by a 3 digit notation `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` , whereby the individual digits represent the following types of software changes shown below:

....
v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>

v     - Version prefix
MAJOR - Breaking change
MINOR - New feature
PATCH - Bug fix
....

The _software implementation version_ follows the popular SemVer scheme, and provides a quick overview for developers about breaking and non-breaking changes in the software.

=== Protocol versioning

The _protocol version_ is denoted by two digits, `H.S.`.
The first digit, `H`, depends on the number of hard forks, and is incremented with each hard fork.
`S` represents the number of soft forks since the last hard fork.

NOTE: The initial protocol version 1.0 is defined as the version that was implemented by Lisk Core v1.0.0.

For example, the _protocol version_ is used in P2P communication between Lisk Core nodes, in order to determine if the nodes have compatible versions of the Lisk protocol implemented.
