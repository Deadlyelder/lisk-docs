{url_github_lisk_service}[Lisk Service^] is a web application that allows interaction with various blockchain networks based on xref:{url_protocol}[Lisk] and xref:{url_bitcoin}[Bitcoin] protocols.

The main focus of Lisk Service is to provide data to the UI clients such as {url_lisk_wallet}[Lisk Desktop] and {url_lisk_wallet}[Lisk Mobile].
Lisk Service makes it possible to access all blockchain live data in a similar way to the regular Lisk SDK API, and in addition provides users with much more details and endpoints, such as geolocation and various statistics about network usage.

The project implementation is based on <<microservices>>.
The technical stack is designed to deliver several microservices, and each of them provides one particular functionality.
The data is served in JSON format and exposed by a xref:{url_api_http}[public RESTful API].

.The Lisk Service microservices
|===
|Microservice |Description

|[[gateway]]{url_github_lisk_service_gateway}[Gateway^]
|The Gateway component provides a RESTful xref:{url_api_http}[HTTP API], which all users of Lisk Service can access and use.
Its main purpose is to proxy API requests from users to other components provided by Lisk Service.
It also maintains backwards compatibility when its public API is changed or replaced by a new version.
This provides users with a **central point of data access** that never breaks existing application compatibility.

|{url_github_lisk_service_lisk}[Lisk^]
|The REST client component acts as a bridge between the Lisk SDK and the <<gateway,Lisk Service Gateway>>.
Its main purpose is to provide enriched data from the xref:{url_sdk_api}[Lisk SDK API].
This component is designed to provide high availability, efficient and reliable access to the Lisk SDK API.

|Bitcoin (planned)
|The Bitcoin component will communicate with {url_electrumx_docs}[ElectrumX^] to retrieve data from the Bitcoin network.
It provides Bitcoin data from the Electrum server and acts as a bridge for the Lisk Service API.

|{url_github_lisk_service_template}[Template^]
|The Template service is an abstract service that all of Lisk Service services are inherited from.
It allows all services to share a similar interface and design pattern.
Its purpose is to reduce code duplication and increase consistency between each service, hence simplifying code maintenance and testing.

== Usage

=== Quick Installation

To install Lisk Service with all its dependencies, execute the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-service.git
cd lisk-service
make up
----

For more information about how to install Lisk Service and its' prerequisites, check out the xref:{url_setup}[Lisk Service setup guides].

=== Stop Lisk Service

[source,bash]
----
make down
----

=== Retrieve data

Once Lisk Service is xref:{url_setup_docker}[set up], xref:{url_config}[configured] and started, it is possible to retrieve data from the xref:{url_api_http}[API].

==== Example request

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9901/api/v1/delegates/active?limit=101&offset=0" -H  "accept: application/json"
