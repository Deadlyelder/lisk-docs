== What is the Lisk SDK?

The {url_github_sdk}[Lisk SDK^] is an open-source software development kit which enables developers to create modular blockchain applications.

The modular architecture of the Lisk SDK allows to configure, exchange or extent any of the blockchain related logic in the application, enabling developers to create the blockchain application with exactly the characteristics they desire.
This is achieved by simply registering new modules and plugins with the application.

The codebase is written entirely in JavaScript and TypeScript, using {url_nodejs}[Node.js^] as underlying engine for code execution.
So developers familiar with JavaScript and/or TypeScript don't need to learn any new language and can start building their apps directly in the programming language they are most familiar with.

---

== What are blockchain applications?

Blockchain applications are applications built with the Lisk SDK.
They generally consist of three main parts:

. a blockchain
. plugins
. communication interfaces

The blockchain logic, or also called on-chain logic, can be defined by registering custom xref:{url_explanations_onchain}[] with the application.
Modules allow to customize nearly all parts of the blockchain related logic as desired.

The xref:{url_explanations_offchain}[] are optional addons to the blockchain application, which complement the blockchain application with additional features.
These features don't make any state changes on the blockchain, but can provide useful additional features like additional API endpoints with aggregrated data related to the blockchain application.

The xref:{url_explanations_communication}[] interfaces allow the different modules and plugins of the blockchain application to communicate with each other.
Additionally the open communication architecture also allows third part applications and services to communicate with the blockchain application over WebSockets or IPC.

All complex and general parts of creating blockchain applications are taken care of by the Lisk SDK.
The application interfaces are designed to only expose the relevant development steps to the developer.
This way a smooth and easy development experience is ensured, and at the same time the developer has all the freedom to design and develop any blockchain application they desire.

In short, the Lisk SDK provides you with a tasty pot of spicy blockchain potpourri, and a full kitchen around it to help you make it *your* decentralized dream dish - a.k.a blockchain application.

.Examples of blockchain applications
****
Examples of blockchain applications can be found in the tutorials, like the xref:{url_tutorials_hello}[], the xref:{url_tutorials_nft}[] or the xref:{url_tutorials_srs}[] application.

Additionally, check out the apps list at {url_lisk_apps}
****

.Interoperability of blockchain applications
[NOTE]
====
In version 5 of the Lisk SDK, every blockchain application is a completely independent blockchain application.

In version 6 of the Lisk SDK, which will be released soon, these blockchain application will be able to connect to the Lisk Mainchain, which will make them sidechains.

Sidechains will be interoperable with each other and the Lisk Mainchain, which will introduce many new interesting use cases to develop services like oracles or prediction markets.
After the implementation of interoperability, all of the most important features of the Lisk SDK will be implemenged.
====

////
=== Comparison to smart contract applications

Blockchain applications built with the Lisk SDK allow a much bigger variety of use cases compared to smart contract platforms.
That's because each blockchain application is running its own custom blockchain, which can be optimized for the specific use case.

In smart contract applications, all contracts are stored on the same blockchain, for example the Ethereum blockchain.
This can cause problems because the smart contract applications need to share the same resource.
One benefit of sidechains in contrast to smart contracts applications is, that issues on one sidechain, for example related to performance or security, will never effect the other sidechains, because each sidechain is maintaining their own blockchain network.

For example, if the traffic on one sidechain is very high, and in result the transaction fees in the network rise, the transaction fees on the other sidechains or the Lisk Mainchain wont be affected by this.
In addition, the logic executed in a blockchain application can be much more complex compared to the logic that can be executed as part of a smart contract.

== Quickstart

=== Dependencies

The following dependencies need to be installed to run the Lisk SDK:

[options="header",]
|===
|Dependencies |Version
|Node.js | v12 (latest)
|===

=== Installation

Create a `package.json` file.

[source,bash]
----
npm init --yes
----

The installation of the Lisk SDK only requires getting a single NPM package `lisk-sdk`, to your Node.js project.

[source,bash]
----
npm install lisk-sdk
----

=== Create the application

Create a new file `index.js` and paste the snippet below.

[NOTE]
====
The `lisk-sdk` package contains the sample objects `genesisBlockDevnet` and `configDevnet` which enable the user to quickly spin up a development blockchain network.
`genesisBlockDevnet` includes a set of preconfigured genesis delegates, that will immediately start forging on a single node to stabilize the network.
`configDevnet` includes the configuration for the Devnet.

Both objects can be customized before passing them to the `Application` instance, if desired.
====

[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet } = require('lisk-sdk'); <1>

const app = Application.defaultApplication(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); <2>

app <3>
	.run()
	.then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
	.catch(error => {
		console.error('Faced error in application', error);
		process.exit(1);
	});
----

<1> Import the `Application`, `genesisBlockDevnet` and `configDevnet` from the `lisk-sdk` package.
<2> Creates a default application, which comes with all default modules.
<3> Starts the application.

=== Start the application

After saving the file with the above contents, start the application in the terminal as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
node index.js
----

To verify the application start, check the log messages in the terminal.
If the start was successful, the application will enable forging for all genesis delegates and will start to add new blocks to the blockchain every 10 seconds.

[NOTE]
====
After completing these steps, the default blockchain application of the Lisk SDK will now be running.

It is now possible to customize your application by registering new xref:{}[modules] and xref:{}[plugins], and also adjusting the genesis block and config to suit your specific use case.

== Getting started

To get started with the Lisk SDK and the development of a blockchain application, please refer to the following sections in the documentation:

=== Quickstart

The quickest way to bootstrap a blockchain application with the Lisk SDK is described on the xref:{url_quickstart}[] page.

=== Tutorials

The xref:{url_tutorials}[Tutorials] explain in detail how to build a specific blockchain application.
All examples provided in the tutorials describe how to implement simple, but valid industry use cases.

The tutorials overview page provides an informative overview about all existing tutorials, including the estimated time and the skill level required to complete each specific tutorial.

TIP: All code for the example apps that is used in the tutorials is also available in the {url_github_sdk_examples}[lisk-sdk-examples repository^] on GitHub.

=== The Lisk protocol

The xref:{url_protocol}[Lisk protocol] is the set of rules followed by a blockchain created with the Lisk SDK using the default configuration.
It contains various development-agnostic specifications about the Lisk SDK.

It is a good location to look up certain topics in order to gain a deeper understanding, or to further explore the SDK in a scientific direction.

=== Architecture

The architecture pages contain various explanations about the architecture of the Lisk Framework.

It contains the following chapters:

* xref:{url_framework}[]
** xref:{url_explanations_onchain}[]
** xref:{url_explanations_offchain}[]
** xref:{url_explanations_communication}[]

=== How-To Guides

The development guides are dedicated how-to guides which cover specific topics required to build a blockchain application with the Lisk SDK.

The most relevant guides for beginners are:

* xref:{url_guides_setup}[]
* xref:{url_guides_config}[]
* xref:{url_guides_module}[]
* xref:{url_guides_asset}[]
* xref:{url_guides_frontend}[]
