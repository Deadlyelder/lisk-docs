= Blocks
A blockchain is composed of blocks. Each block contains a header and a list of transactions which is called the payload. Blocks included in the blockchain have been verified by participating nodes and their payloads constitute the blockchain ledger.

== Block Time
In the Lisk protocol, time is divided into slots of 10 seconds. This interval is called a [#index-block_slot-1]#*block slot*# and at most one block can be added to the blockchain during each slot. The length of a block slot is also called the [#index-block_time-1]#*block time*#.


== Block Forgers
During each block slot, one <<4-consensus-algorithm.adoc#forging-delegate-selection, delegate>> account has the right to add a new block to the blockchain. This delegate will select valid transactions from their <<5-network.adoc#transaction-pool, transaction pool>> and use them to create the block payload. The delegate will then generate the block header and sign it with their private key. The block is then propagated over the network. When receiving blocks, nodes will verify that the block is signed by the appropriate delegate.


== Block Payload
The block payload is an array of transactions. The transactions in the payload are considered as [#index-included-1]#*included*# in the blockchain once the block has been added to the blockchain. The Merkle tree root of this array is computed and included in the block header in the `transactionRoot` property.

When updating the account state with a block, the transactions in the payload are applied sequentially in the order they are given in the payload. This order is also used to assert the validity of the payload. Indeed, transactions have to be valid with respect to the blockchain state obtained by applying all previous blocks and all previous transactions in the payload.

In the Lisk protocol, the payload size is limited to 15 kB.


== Block Header
The block header is generated by the block forger after the block payload. It is composed of the properties detailed in subsections below.


=== `version`
The version of the block represents the version of the protocol used by this block.


=== `timestamp`
An epoch timestamp of when the block is created by the block producer. The timestamp is the number of seconds since the genesis block, hence the genesis block has timestamp 0. This timestamp is used to determine for which block slot the block is created.


=== `previousBlock`
The ID of another block. This property is used to identify the [#index-parent_block-1]#*parent block*#, the block on which this block is built.


=== `height`
This property is 1 for the genesis block. For every other blocks, it is the height of the parent block plus one.


=== `transactionRoot`
The Merkle root of the payload.


=== `generatorPublicKey`
The public key of the delegate who generated the block.


=== `reward`
The reward received by the delegate who generated the block. The value of the reward is described in the section <<rewards-and-fees, Rewards and Fees>>.


=== `signature`
The signature of the block. This signature has to be generated by the private key associated to `generatorPublicKey`. This signature scheme is described in the <<7-appendix.adoc#signature-scheme, Appendix>>.


=== `asset`
This property is used to store information regarding the chain that is not necessarily present on all chains created with the SDK. By default, the block asset contains the three properties below:


* `maxHeightPreviouslyForged`: The maximum height at which the public key in `generatorPublicKey` forged a block. Please see <<4-consensus-algorithm#consensus-votes-on-blocks-and-fork-choice-rule, Consensus Votes on Blocks and Fork Choice Rule>> for more details.


* `maxHeightPrevoted`: The maximum height on the chain which has received 68 prevotes. Please see <<4-consensus-algorithm#consensus-votes-on-blocks-and-fork-choice-rule, Consensus Votes on Blocks and Fork Choice Rule>> for more details.


* `seedReveal`: A pseudo random value used for generating on-chain randomness. To receive the full block reward, the hash of this value has to be the value the forging delegate included in the `seedReveal` property of the last block they forged. See
https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/master/proposals/lip-0022.md#block-header[LIP 0022] for more details.


== Block ID
The block ID is obtained by hashing the <<7-appendix#serialization, serialized>> block header.


== Rewards and Fees
Delegates receive a reward for generating a block. The amount of reward depends on the block height according to the table shown below:

|===
| Heights | Reward
| From 1,451,520 to 4,451,519   | 5 × 10^8^
| From 4,451,520 to 7,451,519   | 4 × 10^8^
| From 7,451,520 to 10,451,519  | 3 × 10^8^
| From 10,451,520 to 13,451,519 | 2 × 10^8^
| From 13,451,520 onwards       | 1 × 10^8^
|===

In the Lisk Mainnet this corresponds to rewards of 5 LSK, 4 LSK, 3 LSK, 2 LSK and 1 LSK.


=== Fees
Transactions also include fees. The <<2-transactions#fee, unburned part of the fee>> is added together with the block reward to the balance of the delegate forging the block. This is done after all transactions in the payload have been applied. It should be noted that a delegate cannot receive and spend the reward in the same block.


=== Reduced Block Reward
The table above shows the default block reward values. However, the Lisk protocol defines specific situations related to the https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/master/proposals/lip-0014.md#incentivizing-lisk-bft-protocol-participation[Lisk-BFT protocol] or the https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/master/proposals/lip-0022.md#validating-new-block-header-property[commit-reveal scheme] in which the block reward is lower.


=== Projected Token Supply

Blockchains following the Lisk protocol do not not have a bounded token supply. For every block forged, the amount of available tokens increases. This increase is obtained by subtracting the burned fees from the block reward.


== Genesis Block
The genesis block is the very first block on the blockchain. It contains all the information about the initial distribution of tokens and the initial information necessary to start generating new blocks. The Genesis block has the following properties: `height`=1, `timestamp`=0, `previousBlock`=null.
