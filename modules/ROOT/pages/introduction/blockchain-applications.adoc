== What are blockchain applications?

A blockchain application is any kind of application which uses its' own blockchain as database layer.

More specifically, in the Lisk documentation, everytime we talk about blockchain applications, we refer to applications which are runnning on blockchains which are compatible with xref:{url_protocol}[].

.Examples of blockchain applications
****
Examples of blockchain applications can be found in the tutorials, like the xref:{url_tutorials_hello}[], the xref:{url_tutorials_nft}[] or the xref:{url_tutorials_srs}[] application.

Additionally, check out the apps list at {url_lisk_apps}

== Blockchain applications vs. dApps

As blockchain applications are also in a sense decentralized applications, you may wonder what is the difference between blockchain applications and dApps, or if there is any difference at all.

In short, the main difference between dApps and blockchain applications is, that blockchain applications each run on their own blockchain/sidechain, while dApps are sharing the blockchain network with other dApps.

dApps are generally constructed as smart contracts, for example on the Ethereum blockchain.
The development of blockchain applications is quite different, as it is much more similar to building a normal web application.
Most functionalities of smart contracts can therefore be implemented in bblockchain application much easier ans straight forward.
But here is one important difference to dApps, when it comes to applying new on-chain logic to the application:
New smart contracts can be directly applied on the running blockchain, while adding new on-chain logic to blockchain applications requires always a hard fork in the network.
Therefore, blockchain applications are less flexible than dApps, when it comes to uploading new logic on the running chain.

If the flexible characteristics of smart contracts are desired inside a blockchain application, it is of course also possible to develop a blockchain application which supports smart contracts.
This way you will have the best of both worlds combined.

The Lisk documentation is referring to applications built with the Lisk SDK as blockchain applications and not dApps to clarify the difference, that applications are not sharing a common blockchain, but instead are each running on their own chain.
As an effect, blockchain applications have the following advantages:

* Lower transaction fees, as high traffic of one blockchain application has no effect on other blockchain applications.
* The blockchain for the application can be designed with the optimal characteristics for the specific use case.
* A much more scalable blockchain, as it only handles the data from one blockchain application.
Therefore it is growing much slower in size, and doesn't suffer so much from possible bottlenecks in the network, which can happen during times of high workload on a lot of different dApps.
* Interoperability: Register a blockchain application as sidechain to connect it to the Lisk Mainchain (coming {url_lisk_roadmap}[soon^]).
This will provide seamless interoperability to the Lisk Mainchain and all of its' connected sidechains.

== Architecture of blockchain applications

These are the most important components of a blockchain application in the context of Lisk:

=== On-chain logic

The on-chain architecture is a layer of abstraction that provides a collection of features to configure and run any business logic on the blockchain.

In short, the on-chain logic:

* introduces state mutations through blocks or transactions.
* is part of the blockchain protocol.
* is verifiable by anyone by synchronizing with the blockchain.
* is handled in *Modules*.

.When to create a new module
[NOTE]
====
Modules enable to...

* define how data is stored on the blockchain
* define logic which is executed per block
* define logic which is executed per transaction
====

The following modules are already inlcuded in the xref:{url_explanations_architecture}[default application], they provide a basic blockchain application with a DPoS blockchain which allows basic token transfers beetween users:

xref:{url_dpos_module}[], xref:{url_token_module}[], xref:{url_keys_module}[], xref:{url_sequence_module}[]

To extend and customize the application, register additional modules to the application.

To add a new module to your application, either reuse an already existing module from another blockchain application, or create a new module based on the specific needs of your application.

For more information, check out the xref:{url_explanations_on_chain}[] introduction and the guide xref:{url_guide_module}[].

=== Off-chain logic
In short, the off-chain logic:

* introduces new blockchain application features.
* is not part of the blockchain protocol.
* is optional to execute on a full node.
* is handled in *Plugins*.

.When to create a custom plugin
[NOTE]
====
Plugins enable to...

* search the blockchain data.
* aggregate the blockchain data.
* provide a UI for the blockchain application.
* automate the blockchain logic, such as automatically seeding transactions.
* add a proxy to the application interfaces.
====

The default application does not include any plugins by default, but the SDK is bundled with a few common plugins which can be directly imported from the Lisk SDK:

xref:{url_references_http_plugin}[], xref:{url_references_forger_plugin}[], xref:{url_references_monitor_plugin}[], xref:{url_references_report_misbbehavior_plugin}[]

To extend and customize the application, register the desired plugins to the application.

To add a new plugin to your application, either reuse an already existing plugin from another blockchain application, or create a new plugin based on the specific needs of your application.

For more information, check out the xref:{url_explanations_off_chain}[] introduction and the guide xref:{url_guide_plugin}[].

=== Communication interfaces

image::communication-architecture.png[]

The communication architecture of the Lisk SDK allows internal application components and external services to communicate to modules and plugins within the application via various channels.

The communication architecture provides two industry standard communication formats, one is Inter Process Communication (IPC) and the other is Web Sockets (WS).
Connect either to the IPC or the WS interface to communicate with the blockchain application.

Communicate to modules and plugins directly by invoking actions via RPC request, or subscribing to events.

If you prefer an HTTP API, you can add support for custom APIs as plugins, like the xref:{url_references_http_plugin}[].
We also recommend to try out xref:{}[Lisk Service], which provides a much more comprehensive HTTP API compared to the plugin.
However, it is recommended to use the IPC/WebSocket protocols where possible, as they provide a much better performance in regards to response times (see the blog post: {url_blog_benchmark}[Benchmarking Lisk Core v3.0.0 against Lisk Core v2.1.6])

For more information, check out the xref:{url_advanced_communication}[advanced explanation] of the communication architecure.
