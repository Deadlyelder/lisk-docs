== What are blockchain applications?

A blockchain application is any kind of application which uses its' own blockchain as database layer.

More specifically, in the Lisk documentation, everytime we talk about blockchain applications, we refer to applications which are runnning on blockchains which are compatible with xref:{url_protocol}[].

.Examples of blockchain applications
****
Examples of blockchain applications can be found in the tutorials, like the xref:{url_tutorials_hello}[], the xref:{url_tutorials_nft}[] or the xref:{url_tutorials_srs}[] application.

Additionally, check out the apps list at {url_lisk_apps}

== Blockchain applications vs. dApps

As blockchain applications are also in a sense decentralized applications, you may wonder what is the difference between blockchain applications and dApps, or if there is any difference at all.

In short, the main difference between dApps and blockchain applications is, that blockchain applications each run on their own blockchain/sidechain, while dApps are sharing the blockchain network with other dApps.

For this reason, dApps are often constructed as smart contracts for example on the Ethereum blockchain.
The developmeent of blockchain applications is quite different, as it is much more similar to building a normal web application.
A lot of functionalities of smart contracts can easily be reimplemented in blockchain applications, though it is of course also possible to develop a blockchain application which supports smart contracts if this is desired.

The Lisk documentation is referring to applications built with the Lisk SDK as blockchain applications and not dApps to clarify the difference, that applications are not sharing a common blockchain, but instead are each running on their own chain.
As an effect, blockchain applications have the following advantages:

* No high transaction fees, as high traffic a blockchain application has no effect on other blockchain applications.
* The blockchain can be designed with the optimal characteristics for the specific use case.
* A much more scalable blockchain, as it only handles the data from one blockchain application.
Therefore it is growing much slower in size, and doesn't suffer so much from possible bottlenecks in the network, which can happen during times of high workload on a lot of different dApps.
* Interoperability: Register a blockchain application as sidechain to connect it to the Lisk Mainchain (coming xref:{url_lisk_roadmap}[soon]).
This will provide seamless interoperability to the Lisk Mainchain and all of its' connected sidechains.

== Important components of blockchain applications

These are the most important components of a bblockchain application in the context of Lisk:

=== On-chain logic

The on-chain architecture is a layer of abstraction that provides a collection of features to configure and run any business logic on the blockchain.

In short, the on-chain logic:

* introduces state mutations through blocks or transactions.
* is part of the blockchain protocol.
* is verifiable by anyone by synchronizing with the blockchain.
* is handled in *Modules*.

.When to create a new module
[NOTE]
====
Modules enable to...

* define how data is stored on the blockchain
* define logic which is executed per block
* define logic which is executed per transaction
====

//TODO: Add link to default appllication
The following modules are already inlcuded in the xref:{}[default application], they provide a basic blockchain application with a DPoS blockchain which allows basic token transfers beetween users:

xref:{url_dpos_module}[], xref:{url_token_module}[], xref:{url_keys_module}[], xref:{url_sequence_module}[]

To extend and customize the application, register additional modules to the application.

To add a new module to your application, either reuse an already existing module from another blockchain application, or create a new module based on the specific needs of your application.

For more information, check out the xref:{url_explanations_on_chain}[] introduction and the guide xref:{url_guide_module}[].

=== Off-chain logic
In short, the off-chain logic:

* introduces new blockchain application features.
* is not part of the blockchain protocol.
* is optional to execute on a full node.
* is handled in *Plugins*.

.When to create a custom plugin
[NOTE]
====
Plugins enable to...

* search the blockchain data.
* aggregate the blockchain data.
* automate the blockchain logic, such as automatically seeding transactions.
* add a proxy to the application interfaces.
====

The default application does not include any plugins by default, but the SDK is bundled with a few common plugins which can be directly imported from the Lisk SDK:

xref:{url_references_http_plugin}[], xref:{url_references_forger_plugin}[], xref:{url_references_monitor_plugin}[], xref:{url_references_report_misbbehavior_plugin}[]

To extend and customize the application, register the desired plugins to the application.

To add a new plugin to your application, either reuse an already existing plugin from another blockchain application, or create a new plugin based on the specific needs of your application.

For more information, check out the xref:{url_explanations_off_chain}[] introduction and the guide xref:{url_guide_plugin}[].

=== Communication interfaces
