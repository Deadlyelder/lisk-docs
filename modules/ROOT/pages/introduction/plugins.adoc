Plugins offer useful features to the application and external services, which are part of the off-chain logic of the blockchain application.
In other words, a plugin will never change the state of the blockchain itself, contrary to the xref:{url_introduction_modules}[modules], which hold the on-chain logic of the blockchain application.

.When to create a plugin
****
Plugins are able to...

* search the blockchain data.
* aggregate the blockchain data.
* provide a UI for the blockchain application.
* automate the blockchain logic, such as automatically seeding transactions.
* add a proxy to the application interfaces.

//== Standalone plugins vs internal plugins

== Adding a plugin to the application

Plugins need to be registered to become available in the application.
If the application was xref:{url_guides_setup}[bootstrapped] with Lisk Commander, they are registered in the file `src/app/plugins.ts`.

.Example: How to register a plugin with the application in `plugins.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
import { Application } from 'lisk-sdk';
import { SomePlugin } from "some-plugin"; // <1>

export const registerPlugins = (app: Application): void => {
    app.registerPlugin(SomePlugin); // <2>
};
----

<1> Import the plugin from an NPM package or from a local path.
<2> Add this line to register the plugin to the application.

== Plugin anatomy

image::intro/plugin-diagram.png[]

All custom plugins must extend the `BasePlugin` exposed by the SDK.
The interface for the `BasePlugin` is described in the xref:{url_references_framework_baseplugin}[Lisk Framework reference].


Plugins expose an interface, similar to the interface for modules.
This interface allows external services to interact with the plugin.
More information about the exposed interface can be found in the section about the xref:{url_advanced_communication}[].




Plugins and the application can interact with each other by using a channel.
Each plugin is given one channel through the `load` function
