The Lisk Framework is an application framework which integrates the Lisk Elements packages in order to form a functioning Lisk blockchain application.
Its modular architecture allows developers to extend the off-chain and on-chain logic with user defined plugins and modules.

The Lisk Framework provides a consistent and intuitive interface between each module and plugin.

The diagram shown below provides a high-level overview of the architecture:

The framework architecture is constructed of three different layer of abstractions.
The `Application` object encapsulates all together to provide a user facing interface.

== On-Chain Architecture
This layer of abstraction provide collection features to configure and run any business logic on the blockchain.
The data associated with features developed with on-chain architecture can be saved to blockchain and business logic can be executed as well.

More information can be found in section xref:{url_explanations_on_chain}[On-chain architecture]

== Off-Chain Architecture
Some business flows or requirements implementation required to perform some computation which is based on the blockchain data but not required to change alter any blockchain state.
It could be a simple use case as creating HTTP API for your blockchain or providing some aggregation service.
The off-chain architecture provide features to cover all such use cases.

More information can be found in section xref:{url_explanations_off_chain}[Off-chain architecture]

== Communication Architecture
Some applications require to work externally still need to communicate with the blockchain.
It could be a CLI or any app developed independently in any other technology stack.
The communication architecture provides two industry standard communication formats, one is Inter Process Communication (IPC) and other is Web Sockets (WS).
You can connect either to IPC or WS interface and can communicate with the blockchain.

More information can be found in section xref:{url_explanations_communication}[Communication architecture]

== Application

The `Application` class is an entry point to create a blockchain application.
It can be instantiated in two ways:

[source,js]
----
//Initiates the Application including all default modules
const app = Application.defaultApplication(genesisBlock, config);
//Initiates the Application without default modules
const app = new Application(genesisBlock, config);
----

`genesisBlock` represents the <<genesis-block>> and `config` represents the application <<configuration>>.

[TIP]
The recommended method to create an `Application` instance, is to use the `defaultApplication` since it comes with the default modules.
If the class constructor is used, the modules need to be registered manually.

=== Registering modules and plugins

In order to register an additional module, the function below should be used.

[source,js]
----
app.registerModule(CustomModule);
----

Additionally, any plugin may be registered with the function below.

[source,js]
----
app.registerPlugin(CustomPlugin);
----

== Configuration

The application config object is passed to the `Application` and must follow the  xref:{url_references_config}[] schema.

== Genesis block

A genesis block must be given to the application, and all networks should have a different genesis block.

The xref:{url_protocol_genesis_block}[genesis block] describes the very first block in the blockchain.
It defines the initial state of the blockchain on start of the network.

The genesis block is not forged by a delegate, such as all of the other blocks which come after the genesis block.
Instead it is defined by the developer, when <<intro,creating the Application>> instance of the blockchain application.

The Lisk SDK exposes an object `genesisBlockDevnet` that holds all of the required important information to spin up a local development network.

.Genesis block schema
[source,js]
----
const genesisBlock = {
  header: {
    generatorPublicKey: "",
    // height can be either 0 or regenesis height
    height: number,
    // empty buffer or merkle root of the previous blocks from previous network
    previousBlockID: Buffer,
    reward: 0n,
    signature: "",
    // timestamp of the blockchain in unix timestamp in second
    timestamp: number,
    // transactionRoot is alway empty hash
    transactionRoot: Buffer.from('e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855', 'hex'),
    version: 0,
    asset: {
      // number of initial round to use the initDelegates
      initRounds: number,
      // address of initial delegates
      initDelegates: Buffer[],
      // encoded accounts for the initial state
      accounts: Buffer[],
    },
  },
  payload: [],
}
----

//TODO: update link to genesis block creation guide
TIP: A valid genesis block can be created using xref:{url_references_elements_genesis}[@liskhq/lisk-genesis].
