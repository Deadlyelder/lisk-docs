The open Lisk communication architecture is based on xref:{url_ipc_socket}[IPC Unix Sockets] and WebSocket.
The `Application` exposes an IPC socket that can be used by internal components like modules and plugins, and by any external service like other scripts in JS, a tool in Rust or a Python daemon.
These external services can connect to this socket and listen to events in the network, or invoke various actions of the `Application`.

== Action and event interfaces

The Lisk Framework defines actions and events which can be invoked and subscribed through a channel.

All modules and plugins will be given a `channel` to communicate with the application via actions and events.

=== The API client

The API client is a Lisk Elements NPM package that can be imported in any JS client application.

It allows to send API requests to a node via IPC or WS.

It also provides an interface to *subscribe* to all events and to *invoke* actions of the application and its' modules & plugins.

[source,js]
----
const { createIPCClient, createWSClient } from '@liskhq/lisk-api-client';
const client = await createIPCClient('~/.lisk/lisk-core');
client = await createWSClient('ws://localhost:8080/ws');

const blockAtHeight123 = await client.block.getByHeight(123);
client.subscribe('pluginAlias:eventAlias', ({ data }) => {
  console.log(data.info);
});
----

More information about the API Client can be found in the xref:{url_references_api_client}[API client reference] and the xref:{url_guides_api_access}[API access guide].

=== How to invoke actions

<<application-actions>> can be invoked through the `channel`.
Additionally, all actions defined in modules and plugins can be called by every module and plugin in the application.

[source,typescript]
----
const { data } = await client.invoke('app:getSchema'); <1>
const { data } = await client.invoke('pluginAlias:getKnownTimestamps'); <2>
const { data } = await client.invoke('moduleAlias:anotherAction'); <3>
const { data }= await client.invoke('app:actionName', input); <4>

<3> How to invoke a module action.
<4> How to invoke an action that needs some input.

=== How to publish and subscribe to events

<<application-events>> can be subscribed and published through the `channel`.
Additionally, all events defined in modules / plugins can be subscribed by every other module and plugin in the application.

.Publishing an event
[source,typescript]
----
channel.publish('pluginAlias:timestamp', { info: 'sample' });
----

.Subscribing to an event
[source,typescript]
----
client.subscribe('pluginAlias:timestamp', ({ data }) => {
  console.log(data.info);
});
----
