= Lisk Mainnet Specifications

The Lisk mainnet is build using the Lisk protocol. 
It has been running for many years and has a few specificities that are not part of the basic Lisk protocol.


== Token

The native token for the Lisk mainnet is the *LSK*. Each LSK is further subdivided into 10^8^ [#index-beddows-1]#*Beddows*#.


== Transactions

The Lisk mainnet supports two additional transactions. 

==== Reclaim

This transactions allows to access the balance that was sent to a legacy address without any associated public key. This legacy address needs to match with the `senderPublicKey` of the transaction.

==== Regenesis

This transaction defines precisely the accounts state and the chain state at a specified regenesis height.
Nodes synchronizing from the regenesis height do not need to apply all the blocks prior to it. 
This allows for lighter nodes in terms of storage and lighter software.

== Network Identifier

The network identifier of the Lisk mainnet is `9ee11e9df416b18bf69dbd1a920442e08c6ca319e69926bc843a561782ca17ee`.
