== 1. Accounts

A Lisk account is a unique identifier called address, an amount of LSK tokens referred to as balance and possibly some extra properties used in other parts of the Lisk protocol.

The account state is not stored as part of the blockchain, but it can be computed by executing all transactions contained in past blocks. Verification of the validity of a transaction requires the state of the referenced accounts.

=== Account Properties

In the following, we list the properties stored in a Lisk account.

==== address

An address is the main identifier of the account. It is used, for example, to identify the recipient when transferring balance between users. The address is calculated as the first 20 bytes of the SHA-256 of the public key.  +
For the front end we provide a https://docs.google.com/document/d/12K9_y8KQWJWRBl9uNsRqyTCS-thbV64F8RQRQJFrEds/edit?folder=1dozSN0we74RYf81aYgoyIoLSZAF5LqW4#heading=h.wey1hm3col5f[human-readable address format], where each address starts with the prefix “_lsk” _and a checksum is appended to signal accidental typing mistakes.

==== balance

The balance is an integer value indicating how many tokens are stored in the account and available to be used. The total number of tokens owned by an account is the sum of the balance and the tokens locked into #heading=h.wn8tgsajax9j[votes] and #heading=h.j1nafjpo9vup[unlocking]. +
In the Lisk protocol, all token amounts are given in Beddows, where 1 LSK = 10^8^ Beddows. Balance can be sent from one account to another using a link:2-transactions.adoc#balance-transfer[Balance Transfer Transaction].

==== publicKey

The public key is used to verify the validity of signatures created by the account using its corresponding private key. Furthermore, the https://drive.google.com/a/lightcurve.io/open?id=12K9_y8KQWJWRBl9uNsRqyTCS-thbV64F8RQRQJFrEds[address is generated from the public key]. +
The public key is set only when the user sends the very first transaction from the account.__ __

==== keys

By default, a transaction issued by an account has to be signed with the private key corresponding to the original public key that generated the account address. However, this default configuration can be changed, and issuing a transaction can require signatures by multiple different private keys (and not necessarily the default one). The corresponding public keys are stored in the keys property. These public keys can be either *mandatory* or *optional*: all mandatory keys have to sign the transaction, and the total number of signatures (mandatory plus optional) has to be equal to numberOfSignatures (also stored in keys). Users can update the keys property with an https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCGxXm2HTaXjiezThr_LqAdpls6wPgh9R4YoLrFGas8/edit#heading=h.x5gpqb6axus[Multisignature Transaction], specifying the mandatory and optional keys and the number of required signatures.

==== nonces

All transactions sent from one account must contain distinct https://drive.google.com/a/lightcurve.io/open?id=1sCGxXm2HTaXjiezThr_LqAdpls6wPgh9R4YoLrFGas8[*nonce]* values. This allows signing and sending multiple transactions with the same asset using different nonces, while at the same time preventing transaction replay. All nonces previously used by an account are stored in this property.

==== asset

The account asset contains all extra information that is specific to a transaction or to the blockchain the account belongs to. In the following, we list the properties there are part of an account asset in the Lisk mainchain.

===== delegate

Accounts registered as delegates store extra information related to https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MCIQVFWD9DXqIq4vt0u2ct8l5cEHtYy9bntvLpFnnho/edit#heading=h.9tnvvtgabf1p[block forging] in this property, like the delegate username or the number of consecutive missed blocks.

===== votes

Votes issued by a user are stored in their account as a list of tuples, each with the voted-delegate address and the amount of voted tokens (in Beddows). Tokens used for voting are *locked*, and cannot be used (or moved from the account) before they have been *unlocked*.

===== unlocking

Tokens used to vote for a delegate are frozen, and have to be unlocked to make them available again. Similarly to the votes property, this property stores the voted-delegate address and the amount, but also the block in which the votes have been removed from the delegate. After the appropriate waiting time, the user can unlock those tokens with an https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCGxXm2HTaXjiezThr_LqAdpls6wPgh9R4YoLrFGas8/edit#heading=h.x5gpqb6axus[Unlock Transaction].
