:experimental:
:v_core: master

This document will explain how to prepare your computer for the workshop.

== Requirements

=== Hardware

* Computer
* Raspberry Pi Zero W, (running a headless Raspbian Buster lite).
* Class 10 SDCard.
* A generic analog light sensor based on an LDR.
* Jumper cables.
* USB <-> Micro-USB cable.

=== Software Pre-requisites

Basic requirements for all machines (xref:setup.adoc[Installation guide by Lisk]):

* A code editor such as Visual Studio Code.
* Git.
* Python 2.
* Node.js `v10` (use `nvm` for easy switching between versions in case a different version is installed).
* Postgres 10.

== 1.0 Setup

Set up the applicable software and hardware and the installation of the dependencies.

=== Clone the repo and install the dependencies

The following steps listed below describe how to create the initial files for this tutorial:

["loweralpha"]
. Clone the Lisk-SDK-Examples repository locally.
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples.git
cd lisk-sdk-examples
cd transport
----
+
The basic file structure can be seen as listed below:
+
.Contents of `lisk-sdk-examples/transport`

+
<1> Contains the code for the xref:tutorials/transport1.adoc#_project_architecture[client application].
<2> Contains the code for the xref:tutorials/transport1.adoc#_project_architecture[IoT application].
<3> Contains the code for the xref:tutorials/transport1.adoc#_project_architecture[node application].
<4> Contains the custom transactions that are used by the node and client app.
. Navigate inside the `transport/transactions` and `transport/node` folders, and then run `npm install` to install the required dependencies for the node application.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd transactions
npm install
cd ../node
npm install
----

. Setup the database as listed below:
.. If a previous database was created then it will be necessary to delete it and re-create a new one using the following command: `dropdb lisk_dev && createdb lisk_dev --owner lisk`.
. To verify if the setup is correct, try to run the application with the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
node index.js | npx bunyan -o short
----

This command will run the `index.js` file and pipe the outputted logs to the preferred log formatting tool Bunyan.
Please be aware that when starting the node for the first time, this may require a few minutes.

If everything is running correctly, the node can be stopped by pressing kbd:[CTRL+C].

TIP: In case the node crashes or does not function correctly, follow  https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/blob/development/transport/DOCKER.md[this guide] to set up a dedicated development environment using Docker and Docker-Compose.
The script will set up the whole environment.
If the instructions in this guide are followed correctly, the remainder of this document can be skipped.

=== Prepare the IoT device

Sensor wiring::
image:lisk_rpi_ldr_and_temperature_sensors_wiring.png[RPI Wiring,title="RPI Wiring"]

Preparing the Operating System::
The operating system for the Raspberry needs to be copied from a computer into an SD card for this we recommend using https://www.balena.io/etcher/ (good tutorial in https://medium.com/@ccarnino/backup-raspberry-pi-sd-card-on-macos-the-2019-simple-way-to-clone-1517af972ca5)
+
For preparing the Raspberry for `ssh` and wifi access follow this guide: https://core-electronics.com.au/tutorials/raspberry-pi-zerow-headless-wifi-setup.html
+
As we want to run the Raspberry in headless mode (i.e. no keyboard, mouse and monitor) we need to also enable `ssh` through USB.
To do so follow this guide https://desertbot.io/blog/ssh-into-pi-zero-over-usb
Once all those steps are followed the SD card can be unmounted and inserted into the Raspberry SD card reader.

Already isntalled libraries for accessing sensor data::
The pins in the Raspberry need some libraries before they can be used for communicating with different sensors.
For installing the required libraries run:

* `sudo apt-get install wiringpi`
* `sudo apt-get install pigpio`
* NodeJS can be installed with `nvm`

Connecting / Logging in to the Pi::
For logging in into the Pi plug it using the usb port labeled ***usb*** wait about a minute for it to boot (the green light in the Pi will stop flashing when it's done booting) and then open a terminal and:
+
* *ssh pi@raspberrypi.local*
* Type in the password -- by default this is `raspberry`
