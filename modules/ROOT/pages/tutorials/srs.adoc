In the SRS tutorial, you learn step-by-step how to create a blockchain application which offers users a feature to recover the balance of their accounts for the scenario that they have lost/forgotten their passphrase.

The goal is to build an account recovery tool where a user asks friends to give the user access to the funds of a lost account.
The user defines a recovery configuration initially by setting a list of friends and some other parameters for the recovery.

TIP: For the *full code example* please see the {url_github_srs}[SRS app on GitHub^].

== SRS application overview

image:tutorials/srs/srs-overview.png[]

As the above image describes, we need to create the following components:

. The NFT module (on-chain)
.. Three new transaction assets for the NFT module
. The NFT plugin (off-chain)

Additional to the blockchain application, we will also implement **frontend application**, which allows us to interact with the blockchain applicationn through a UI in the browser.

== Project setup

Create a new folder which will contain all the files for the SRS app:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir srs
mkdir srs/blockchain_app
cd srs/blockchain_app
npm init --yes
npm i lisk-sdk
----

Next, create a new file `index.js` and paste the following:

.srs/blockchain_app/index.js
[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet } = require('lisk-sdk');

const app = Application.defaultApplication(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet);

app
	.run()
	.then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
	.catch(error => {
		console.error('Faced error in application', error);
		process.exit(1);
	});
----

This code snippet creates a default blockchain application, which is configured for development purposes.
We will use this app as basis for the SRS app and extend it with a module and a plugin in the next steps, to suit the desired use case.

Create a new folder `srs_module/` and inside a new file `index.js`:

.srs/blockchain_app/
[source,bash]
----
mkdir srs_module
----
