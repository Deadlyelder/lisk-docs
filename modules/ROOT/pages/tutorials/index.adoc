Get onboarded to the Lisk SDK with step-by-step walkthroughs that simplify the process of developing a proof of concept blockchain application.

== What do the tutorials cover?

* How to initially set up the Lisk SDK and get the network started.
* How to develop a new transaction type and how to register it with the application.
* How to create a sendable transaction object of the new type, and broadcast it to the network.

== Hello World

Built using the Alpha SDK, our Hello World application explains how to create a new transaction type from scratch.

Hello World is a simple example to showcase how to create a new transaction type by implementing the xref:customize.adoc[BaseTransaction interface].

== Cashback

The Cashback application shows you how to create a new custom transaction inherited from a pre-existing transaction type.

Built by extending the balance transfer transaction, in addition to the regular transfer functionality, the cashback transaction also applies an inflationary 10% to the senders account.

This tutorial is an example of a simple but valid use case - a cashback transaction.

This tutorial covers a large variety of topics, and is therefore covered in the following 4 pages:

* xref:tutorials/transport.adoc[General Introduction:] Contains motivation, ideas, and an overview of the concept with an explanation per custom transaction.
* xref:tutorials/transport0.adoc[Part 0:] Installation & Setup
* xref:tutorials/transport1.adoc[Part 1:] Start of the tutorial, how to track a packet on blockchain
* xref:tutorials/transport2.adoc[Part 2:] Second part of the tutorial implementing supply chain tracking system
