== A
=== Account

An account consists of a unique identifier / <<account-address,address>>, an amount of tokens referred to as balance and possibly some additional properties used in other parts of the blockchain application.

=== Account Address

Addresses are unique identifiers for accounts in the Lisk blockchain.
They are the 20-byte hash value of the public key that controls the account initially.
In all front-end products, addresses are displayed in a human-readable representation called <<Lisk32-representation>>.
An example for an address in Lisk32 presentation is `lskxwnb4ubt93gz49w3of855yy9uzntddyndahm6s`.
When referring to addresses in Lisk, we always assume the Lisk32 representation, without explicitly having to mention it.
In the Lisk protocol and SDK only the 20 byte value is stored for efficiency and sometimes the hexadecimal representation of the address is used.
Further details regarding other address representations can be seen here in the xref:{url_data_structure}[table for different data types] on the schema reference page.

=== Active Delegate

An active delegate can mostly be considered as a forging delegate, who is able to forge new blocks for the Lisk blockchain. Rank 1-101.

=== AES-256-CBC - Advanced Encryption Standard

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), has a key length of 256 bits and is a block cipher adopted as an encryption standard by the U.S. government for military and government use. CBC (Cipher Blocker Chaining), is an advanced form of block cipher encryption. A detailed description of how AES functions can be found {url_aes}[here^].

=== API - Application Programming Interface

=== Betanet

A temporary, public testing network for the Lisk Core beta candidate.

=== BFT - Byzantine Fault Tolerance

In a system whereby components need to come to an agreement to reach consensus,  byzantine failures will prevent those components from reaching an agreement, (usually caused by errors that are hard to detect).
A Byzantine Fault Tolerant system ensures that measures are taken to manage such failures.

=== BIP - Bitcoin Improvement Proposal

For example, a BIP39 describes the mnemonic code or mnemonic sentence implementation. It is a protocol that describes how to create a human readable mnemonic sentence and how to convert that mnemonic into a seed.

=== Blockchain Application

An application running on its own blockchain built with the Lisk SDK.

=== Blockchain App

Short form of blockchain application.

=== Block Header

A block is composed of a block header and a payload of transactions. The block header contains all information related to the block as well as a hash of the payload.

=== Block Height

The number of blocks in the blockchain between the genesis block and the block of the specified block height.

=== Block ID

A xref:{url_delegate_misbehavior}[delegate misbehavior report] refers to a transaction type on the Mainnet which reports a delegates misbehavior. +
Any misbehavior of a delegate is xref:{url_discover_misbehavior}[indicated] by two contradicting block headers signed by the delegate.

=== Delegate Registration

A xref:{url_delegate_registration}[delegate registration] is achieved via a transaction type on the Mainnet, which registers a delegate to participate in the Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm.

=== Delegate Vote

A transaction type on Mainnet which submits votes for delegates. If the votes are positive it adds the voting weight, if they are negative it removes the voting weight again. If voting weight was added, the corresponding LSK are locked and cannot be used for any other transaction.

=== Devnet

A temporary, internal-only testing network running on an individual developerâ€™s machine during development.

=== DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol can be defined as a client/server protocol that automatically provides a host with its IP address. This also includes additional related configuration information such as the default gateway and the subnet mask.

=== DPoS - Delegated Proof of Stake

xref:{url_dpos}[DPoS] is the mechanism of determining eligible block creators achieved by voting for registered delegate accounts, which are then able to create blocks depending on their vote weight. It is part of the consensus algorithm of a blockchain and used on Lisk Mainnet and in the Lisk SDK.

== E

=== Forging

How delegates produce blocks on the Lisk blockchain.

=== Fork

A fork in the network is whereby an alternative version of the blockchain is created by generating two blocks on different parts of the network simultaneously.

=== Framework Plugin

A self-contained, off chain component which extends the standard feature set of the Lisk SDK by a specific use case, e.g. a node monitor plugin or delegate forging plugin. Typically there is no state change on the blockchain.


== G

=== Genesis Block

The xref:{url_genesis_block}[genesis block] describes the very first block in the blockchain. It defines the initial state of the blockchain on start of the network. A genesis block must be given to the application, and all networks should have a different genesis block.

== H

=== LIP - Lisk Improvement Proposal

A LIP is a document usually structured by the research team defining technical changes in the Lisk protocol. In addition, it can also cover an implementation or a non technical process surrounding Lisk. Furthermore, a LIP also describes the requirements, rationale and motivation for the required changes.
=== Lisk32 representation

The Lisk32 representation of <<account-addresses>> starts with the letters "lsk" followed by a custom Base32 encoding of the 20 bytes of the address appended with a BCH checksum.
The checksum is used to check for small errors in the address.
Any errors in up to 4 characters are guaranteed to be detected and errors in more than 5 characters are likely to be detected.
The choice of the Lisk32 representation of addresses does not modify the address, but is introduced to provide a safer and more pleasant experience to users.
