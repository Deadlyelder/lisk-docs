This section consists of concise, goal-oriented how-to guides, that are designed in a manner to help the user to solve specific issues.

The guides are listed in a chronological order, taking you through the basic steps of developing a blockchain application with the Lisk SDK.

== The Hello World app

As example, the guides use the {url_github_hello}[Hello World] app, which is a very basic blockchain application with one custom transaction type and a simple frontend.

This basic example describes a minimal set of code, that is needed to implement a blockchain application.

If you want to follow the guides 1-to-1, we recommend to set up the Hello World app like described below.

Or you may directly start with your own use case or a xref:{url_tutorials}[tutorial], and just come back to the guides to look up certain topics.

To set up the Hello World app, first install the xref:{url_setup}[prerequisites], then clone the repository and navigate into it:

.In the terminal
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples.git
cd lisk-sdk-examples/hello_world
----

Now install all required node modules for the node application:

.lisk-sdk-examples/hello_world
[source,bash]
----
npm install
----

Then, to spin up the devnet node execute:

.lisk-sdk-examples/hello_world
[source,bash]
----
node index.js | npx bunyan -o short
----

If the setup was successful, you should see the logs of the node in the terminal.

Once the node is started, it will spin up a local devnet with only one node, and all 101 genesis delegates forging on that node.
The delegates will then add a new block to the blockchain, which is also visible in the logs every 10 seconds.

All further parts of the Hello Word application are explained in the dedicated Lisk SDK guides.

== Main Guides

The most important parts of building a blockchain application are:

. The xref:{url_config}[configuration guide] covers how to configure a blockchain application and how to modify the default values.
. The xref:{url_custom}[custom transactions guide] explains how to add and register a new transaction type.
. In the xref:{url_frontend}[connect a frontend guide], it is explained how to develop a {url_react}[React] frontend for a blockchain application.
. Finally, the xref:{url_launch}[launch the app guide] describes the steps needed to move from a local devnet to a public blockchain network.
