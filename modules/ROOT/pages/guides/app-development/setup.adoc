How to create a new blockchain application with the Lisk SDK.

[TIP]

====
To get started with the development of a blockchain application in the most simple and efficient manner, it is *recommended* to follow the guide <<bootstrapping-a-new-blockchain-application-with-lisk-commander>>.

If you prefer to not use Lisk Commander to get started with development, the <<manual-setup-alternative-without-lisk-commander>> is explained below.
====

== Bootstrapping a new blockchain application with Lisk Commander

Lisk Commander offers various commands related to <<initializing-a-new-blockchain-application>> which can be used to conveniently get started with developing a blockchain application.

=== Supported Operating Systems

The Lisk Commander will run on both the Ubuntu and MacOS operating systems shown below:

Ubuntu +

* 18.04 (LTS)
* 20.04 (LTS)

MacOS +

* 10.13 (High Sierra) +
* 10.14 (Mojave) +
* 10.15 (Catalina) +
* 11.04 (Big Sur) +

Please note that the MS Windows operating system is not supported.

=== Dependencies

* Node.js v12 (latest)

If you are using NVM, install the correct version as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
nvm install v12.22.1
----

=== Installing Lisk Commander

It is recommended to install Lisk Commander globally with NPM to facilitate the convenient usage of the Lisk Commander CLI.

[source,bash]
----
npm install --global --production lisk-commander
----

=== Initializing a new blockchain application

In this example, we want to create a new blockchain application with the name `new_app`.

Therefore, create a dedicated folder `new_app/`, which will contain the files for the application.

Inside of this folder, execute the `init` command of Lisk Commander as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir new_app
cd new_app
lisk init
----

The user is asked for the application name, description, author, and license after running `lisk init`.

Next, all the required files are created by Lisk Commander.

----

NOTE: The application CLI offers various commands to conveniently manage your blockchain application.

As shown in the snippet above, a new folder `src/commands/` will be created, which contains all files for the available command-line commands of the application.

To run the application CLI, execute the following command in the root folder of the application:

./new_app/
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run
----

Running the CLI command without any arguments will display the general command reference:

=== Starting the application

The blockchain application will have the following file structure after the first initialization:

----
.
├── bin/ <1>
│   ├── run
│   └── run.cmd
├── config/ <2>
│   └── default/
│       ├── config.json

│   │   └── plugins.ts
│   └── commands/ <5>
└── tsconfig.json
----

<1> `bin/`: Contains the script to run the CLI of the application.
<2> `config/`: Contains the configuration and the genesis block used by the application.
<3> `modules/`: Contains internal modules of the application.
This folder is empty after the first initialization with `lisk init`.
The command `lisk generate:module` creates new modules in this folder.
<4> `plugins/`: Contains internal plugins of the application.
This folder is empty after the first initialization with `lisk init`.
The command `lisk generate:plugin` creates new modules in this folder.
<5> `commands/`: Contains the logic for the CLI commands of the application.
The files for the different commands can be adjusted and extended as desired, for example, to include new flags and commands.

Use the following command to start the blockchain application.

[source,bash]
----
./bin/run start
----

The `start` command offers various options, allowing further configuration of the application.
For example, it is possible to define ports or to enable plugins that will be used by the application.

See the full list of available options in the reference below.

=== Next steps

By installing Lisk Commander and running `lisk init`, you have now a working blockchain application with the default configurations for runnning in a local devnet.

To extend the application further, you need to register additional modules and/or plugins with your application.
Either import external modules and plugins, or create completely new modules and plugins with the Lisk SDK.

More information can be found on the following pages:

* xref:{url_modules_registration}[How to register a new module with the application]
* xref:{url_guide_module}[]

== Manual Setup (alternative without Lisk Commander)

How to create a new blockchain application manually without using the Lisk Commander.

=== Dependencies

* Node.js v12 (latest)

If you are using NVM, install the correct version as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
nvm install v12.22.1
----

=== Project setup

Create a new folder for the blockchain application and navigate into it.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir my_blockchain_app
cd my_blockchain_app
----

Create a `package.json` file.

[source,bash]
----
npm init --yes
----

Install the `lisk-sdk` package.

[source,bash]
----
npm i lisk-sdk
----

=== Creating a blockchain application

Create a new file `index.js`.
We want to use this file to store the code that will start the blockchain application by using the Lisk SDK.

In `index.js`, import the `Application`, `genesisBlockDevnet` and `configDevnet` from the the `lisk-sdk` package.

[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet } = require('lisk-sdk');
----

Now use the objects to create a blockchain application:

[source,js]
----
const app = Application.defaultApplication(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet);
----

This will create a new blockchain application that uses `genesisBlockDevnet` as the genesis block for the blockchain, and `configDevnet`to configure the application with common default options to run a node in a development network.

[NOTE]
====
The `lisk-sdk` package contains the sample objects `genesisBlockDevnet` and `configDevnet` which enable the user to quickly spin up a development blockchain network.
`genesisBlockDevnet` includes a set of preconfigured genesis delegates, that will immediately start forging on a single node to stabilize the network.
`configDevnet` includes the configuration for the Devnet.

Both objects can be customized before passing them to the `Application` instance, if desired.

More information can be found in the guide xref:{url_guide_config}[].
====

Use `app.run()` to start the application:

[source,js]
----
app
	.run()
	.then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
	.catch(error => {
		console.error('Faced error in application', error);
		process.exit(1);
	});
----

After adding all of the above contents, save the file.
Now it is possible to start a blockchain application with a default configuration, that will connect to a local devnet.

=== Starting the application

Start the application as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
node index.js
----

To verify the application start, check the log messages in the terminal.
If the start was successful, the application will enable forging for all genesis delegates and will start to add new blocks to the blockchain every 10 seconds.

[NOTE]
====
After completing these steps, the default blockchain application of the Lisk SDK will now be running.

It is now possible to customize your application by registering new modules and plugins, and also adjusting the genesis block and config to suit your specific use case.
