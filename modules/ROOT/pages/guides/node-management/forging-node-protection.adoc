== Overview

This guide walks the user through setting up a forging node in a step-by-step process. Firstly, a forging node `F` will be set up, as well as 2 trusted nodes `Nx`.
`F` will be permanently connected to `Nx`, and will not accept connections from any IP address.
This will then be enforced by using unidirectional communication only with trusted nodes, by setting up firewalling rules on the forging node.

NOTE: There is no requirement to have a specific number of trusted nodes, however it is recommended to have no less than 2 for resiliency.

== Setup

[NOTE]
====
The trusted nodes should be spread geographically across service providers to prevent concurrent outages.
If all trusted nodes become unreachable at the same time then the forging node cannot operate.
====

All 3 nodes are installed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS according to the following:

* xref:{url_core_binary_setup}[Lisk Core binary setup]
* xref:{url_sdk_setup}[Lisk SDK setup]

We will assume our forging node has the following example IPv4 address: `192.0.0.1`.
In addition it is assumed that our trusted nodes have the following IPv4 addresses:

* `198.51.100.1`
* `203.0.113.1`

All nodes are assumed to listen to port `4000`.

.Trusted nodes configuration
[source,js]
----
{
  network: {
    whitelistedPeers: [{
      // this is our forging node
      ip: "192.0.0.1",
      port: 4000
    }],
}
----

.Forging node configuration
[source,js]
----
{
  network: {
    // Limit the maximum number of outbound connections to 2, the number of the trusted nodes
    maxOutboundConnections: 2,
    // Disallow inbound connections
    maxInboundConnections: 0,
    // Do not advertise our IPv4
    advertiseAddress: false,
    // Do not connect to any seed peer (the trusted nodes will be used, see below)
    seedPeers: [],
    // Those are our trusted nodes
    fixedPeers: [{198.51.100.1:4000, 203.0.113.1:4000}],
  }
}
----

== Firewalling

It is recommended to only allow incoming SSH (`tcp/22`) connections on the forging node.
The {url_ufw}[UFW^] (Uncomplicated Firewall), is included by default on Ubuntu and can be used for this purpose.
An alternative example using `firehol` can also be found below.

=== UFW example

To activate the UFW firewall with the desired configurations, run the following commands:

.UFW example
[source,bash]
----
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose
----

The last commands output should be similar to the following:

----
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)
New profiles: skip

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
----

Refer to {url_ubuntu_firewall}[^] for more information.

=== firehol example

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get --assume-yes install firehol <1>
sudo vim /etc/firehol/firehol.conf <2>
----

<1> Installs firehol.
<2> Opens the firehol config file.

Paste the following contents into the firehol config file:

.Sample `/etc/firehol/firehol.conf`
[source,bash]
----
interface eth0 wan
  policy drop
  server icmp accept
  server ssh accept
  client all accept
----

Press kbd:[Esc] + kbd:[:] kbd:[w] kbd:[q] + kbd:[Enter] to save the file and quit.

Now run the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
sudo firehol try <1>
sudo sed -i 's/^START_FIREHOL=.*$/START_FIREHOL=yes/' /etc/default/firehol <2>
----

<1> Checks the configuration and then activates the firewall.
This commands will ask for confirmation as a fail-safe and will reverse all changes if none is given after 30 seconds.
<2> Sets `START_FIREHOL=yes` in `/etc/default/firehol` which will start the firewall automatically at boot time.

Refer to {url_firehol}[^] for more information.
