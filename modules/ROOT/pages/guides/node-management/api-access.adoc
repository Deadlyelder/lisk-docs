    httpApi: { <1>
		port: 4000,
		whiteList: ['127.0.0.1'], <2>
		cors: {
			origin: '*',
			methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT'],
		},

<1> Contains options for the API module.
<2> This parameter allows connections to the API by IP.
Defaults to only allow local host.

The recommended setup is to configure a whitelist for only trusted IP addresses, such as your home connection.
Use IPV4 addresses only as the whitelist does not support IPV6.
