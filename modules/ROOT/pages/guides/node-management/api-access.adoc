Controlling access to a node plays a vital role in security.
The following configurable flags are available to control the access to your node:

.API access options in the configuration JSON
[source%linenums,js]
----
{
  "modules": {
    "http_api": { <1>
      "enabled": true, <2>
      "access": { <3>
        "public": false, <4>
        "whiteList": ["127.0.0.1"], <5>
      },
    }
  }
}
----

<1> Contains options for the API module.
<2> Controls the API's availability.
If disabled, no API access is possible.
<3> Contains API access options.
<4> If true, the API endpoints of the node are available to the public.
<5> This parameter allows connections to the API by IP. The default is to only allow a local host.

The recommended setup is to configure a whitelist for only trusted IP addresses, such as your home connection.
Use IPV4 addresses only as the whitelist does not support IPV6.

To set up a public wallet, simply leave the `modules.http_api.access.whitelist` array empty.

For optimal security, disable all access by setting `modules.http_api.enabled` to `false`.

NOTE: This last configuration may prevent monitoring scripts from functioning.
