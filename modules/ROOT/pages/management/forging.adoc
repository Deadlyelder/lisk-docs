[IMPORTANT]

Keep in mind you need to use the right ports for the network that your Lisk Core node is connected to.
A reference of all HTTP ports of Lisk Core can be seen below.

.HTTP ports
****
The HTTP Port can be different based on your configuration, therefore it is recommended to check the `httpPort` in your config.

The *default ports* for the different networks are:

* 4000 (Devnet)
* 5000 (Betanet)
* 7000 (Testnet)
* 8000 (Mainnet)
