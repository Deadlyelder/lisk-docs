The Lisk SDK operates on the Node.js runtime and consists primarily of an application framework (<<the-lisk-framework>>).
This consists of a collection of libraries providing blockchain application functionalities (xref:{url_elements}[Lisk Elements]), and a powerful Command Line Interface (xref:{url_commander}[Lisk Commander]), which allows developers to manage a Lisk node instance and interact with a Lisk compatible network.

|===
| Component | Description
| <<the-lisk-framework,Framework>> | Lisk Framework is an application framework responsible for establishing and maintaining the interactions between the modules of a Lisk blockchain application.

| xref:{url_elements}[Elements] | Lisk Elements is a collection of libraries, each of them implementing some form of blockchain application functionality such as cryptography, transactions, p2p, etc.
Each library is designed to be compatible with xref:{url_protocol}[].

| xref:{url_commander}[Commander] | Lisk Commander is a command line tool which allows the management of a Lisk node instance and interaction with a Lisk compatible network.
|===


== Application

The framework architecture is constructed of three different layer of abstractions: `Node`, `Modules` and `Plugins` (see the <<architecture-diagram,architecture diagram>>).
The `Application` object encapsulates all together to provide a user-facing interface.

The `Application` class is the entry point to create a blockchain application.
It can be instantiated in two ways:

[source,js]
----
//Initiates the Application including all default modules
const app = Application.defaultApplication(genesisBlock, config);
//Initiates the Application without default modules
const app = new Application(genesisBlock, config);
----

`genesisBlock` represents the <<genesis-block>> and `config` represents the <<configuration>> for the application.

[TIP]
The recommended method to create an `Application` instance is to use the `defaultApplication`, since it comes with the default modules.
If the class constructor is used, the modules need to be registered manually.

== Configuration

The application config object is passed to the `Application` and must follow the configuration schema.

[NOTE]
It is not necessary to include all options that are included in the schema.
The application will use the default configuration options in case a config option is not specified.



More information about how to configure a blockchain application can be found in the guide xref:{url_guides_config}[].

== Genesis block

A genesis block must be given to the application, and all networks should have a different genesis block.

The xref:{url_protocol_genesis_block}[genesis block] describes the very first block in the blockchain.
It defines the initial state of the blockchain on start of the network.

The genesis block is not forged by a delegate, such as all of the other blocks which come after the genesis block.
Instead it is defined by the developer, when creating the Application instance of the blockchain application.

TIP: Check the xref:{url_guide_genesis_block}[] guide to learn how to create a valid genesis block.

.Genesis block schema
[source,js]
----
const genesisBlock = {
  header: {
    generatorPublicKey: "",
    // height can be either 0 or regenesis height
    height: number,
    // empty buffer or merkle root of the previous blocks from previous network
    previousBlockID: Buffer,
    reward: 0n,
    signature: "",
    // timestamp of the blockchain in unix timestamp in second
    timestamp: number,
    // transactionRoot is alway empty hash
    transactionRoot: Buffer.from('e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855', 'hex'),
    version: 0,
    asset: {
      // number of initial round to use the initDelegates
      initRounds: number,
      // address of initial delegates
      initDelegates: Buffer[],
      // encoded accounts for the initial state
      accounts: Buffer[],
    },
  },
  payload: [],
}

== Life cycle of a block

If a node receives a new block, it always performs the following actions.

The *bold* steps are the steps exposed to the developer via the base module and base asset, see the xref:{url_references_framework_basemodule}[Lisk Framework reference].

. Receive block
. Apply fork choice rule
. Validate block
.. Validate transactions
... Validate transaction
... *Validate transaction asset*
. Verify block header
. *Before block apply*
. *Apply block*
.. Apply transactions
... *beforeTransactionApply*
... *Apply asset*
... *afterTransactionApply*
. *After block apply*
. Save block and updated states
