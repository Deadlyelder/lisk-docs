[[distributions]]
== How to set up a node?

There are four available distributions of Lisk Core which are described below. Simply follow the instructions in this setup guide for your desired distribution.

=== Application

This is the *default* procedure to setup Lisk Core.
The xref:{url_binary_installation}[Application installation] offers an easy and automated approach to set up Lisk Core. This includes almost completely automated update scripts, together with a selection of tools to assist with seamlessly maintaining a Lisk Core node. This is the recommended installation for the less experienced user.

=== Commander application

Use xref:{url_lisk_commander}[Lisk Commander application] to conveniently install and manage Lisk Core.

=== Docker image

The xref:{url_docker}[Docker image] adds support for additional platforms upon which to run a Lisk node.
 This offers the possibility to containerize the node.

=== Source code

This is designed for anyone wishing to develop on the Lisk Core codebase.
It also comes with an extensive test-suite which is described in the following `README.md`.
An installation performed from the xref:{url_source}[source code] enables a developer to work on the latest codebase of Lisk Core, which may not have been tagged for a release yet.
