To install and use Lisk Service just follow the respective setup guides.

== Docker image

The most convenient way to set up Lisk Service.

The xref:{url_setup_docker}[docker] image will install all required dependencies, that are needed to run Lisk Service on your machine.

== Source code

As alternative to the Docker image setup, it is also possible to install Lisk Service xref:{url_setup_source}[from Source code].

This setup requires more steps than the Docker image installation, but it enables to check out versions of the software, that are not tagged for a release, yet.
Therefore it is mostly interesting for developers, who want to contribute to the development of Lisk Service.
