To install and use Lisk Service just follow the respective setup guides.

== Docker image

The most convenient way to set up Lisk Service.

The xref:{url_setup_docker}[docker] image will install all required dependencies that are needed to run Lisk Service on your machine.

== Source code

TIP: Install from source code if you want to customize the codebase of Lisk Service, for example by adjusting the API to be fully compatible your blockchain application.

As alternative to the Docker image setup, it is also possible to install Lisk Service xref:{url_setup_source}[from source code].

This setup requires more steps than the Docker image installation, but enables the developer to customize Lisk Service codebase.
