Setup and manage your Lisk Core node conveniently with Lisk Commander.



== Pre-install

To complete the installation some prerequisites need to be fulfilled.
If you have already performed these, please proceed to the <<install, Installation>> chapter.

=== Install Lisk Commander

Please access the Lisk Commander documentation and follow the xref:{url_sdk_commander_setup}[installation instructions].

Once Lisk Commander is set up on your system, it is possible to use the commands below to set up and manage your Lisk Core node.

[[install]]
== Installation

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not run this command with a user that has `sudo` rights. +
If this is executed then the installation will be aborted, as it is not required and not recommended to install Lisk Core for a user with `sudo` rights.
====

[TIP]
====
Please choose the name of your Lisk Core instance.

Please note that you need to refer to your custom name instead of `lisk-mainnet` or `lisk-testnet` when running these commands.
====

[tabs]
====
Betanet::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
lisk core:install --network=betanet lisk-betanet
----

This will install the latest version of Lisk Core into a directory `~/.lisk/instances/lisk-betanet`.

To verify your node is running correctly, execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
lisk core:status lisk-betanet
----
--
Mainnet::
+
--
See xref:{url_core_2_setup}[Lisk Core 2.1.6 commander setup]
--
Testnet::
+
--
See xref:{url_core_2_setup}[Lisk Core 2.1.6 commander setup]
--
====

TIP: All available options can be seen in the xref:{url_sdk_commander_commands}[Lisk Commander Command reference for Lisk Core] as well as the xref:{url_sdk_commander_commands}[General command reference].

=== Available options

Add one or multiples of the options below to the `core:install` command.
Multiple options are separated by spaces.

|===
| Full Name | Short Name | Examples | Description

| `--network` | `-n`
a|
* `--network=testnet`
* `--network=betanet`
* `-n=alphanet`
* `--network=devnet`
| The network, you want Lisk Core to connect to. If you do not specify this option, it will connect to the default network (Mainnet).

| `--release-url` | `-r`
| `--release-url=https://my-custom.url/testnet/2.1.0-rc.0/lisk-2.1.0-rc.0-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
| Define a custom URL for downloading the new Lisk Core application script.
It is also necessary to have the checksum for the TAR file, with the format 2.0.0-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz.SHA256 for the Commander to check the integrity of the application.
Please refer to the {url_binary_download}[Lisk Core application releases^] for the file naming convention.

| `--lisk-version` | N/A
a|
* `--lisk-version=2.0.0`
* `--lisk-version=2.1.3`
| Define the exact version that Lisk Core should be upgraded to.
If you do not specify the version, it will install the latest stable version of Lisk Core.

| `--snapshot-url` | `-s`
| `--snapshot-url=https://snapshots.lisk.io/lisk/testnet/lisk_test_backup-9299232.gz`
| Define a custom URL for downloading the xref:{url_snapshots}[snapshot], that should be used during the setup of Lisk Core.

| `--no-snapshot` | N/A
| N/A | Set this option, if you do not wish to use any snapshots during the setup of Lisk Core.
In this case, your node will synchronize the whole blockchain, starting from the genesis block.
If you choose this option, the setup process will take significantly longer.

| `--no-start` | N/A
| N/A | Set this option, if you do not wish to start Lisk Core automatically after the installation.
|===

== Post-install

After the installation is completed, check which ports Lisk Core is listening to.
To do that, check the status of Lisk Core by using the command shown below:

[tabs]
====
Betanet::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
lisk core:status lisk-betanet
----
--
====

Then check the network settings to verify the corresponding ports are open.

In addition it is also recommended to set up a xref:{url_config_logrotation}[log rotation].

If you are not running Lisk Core locally, you will need to follow the xref:{url_config_api_access}[Control API access] guide to enable access.

If all of the above steps have been successfully completed, the next step is to move on to the configuration section.
If you wish to enable forging or SSL, please see the xref:{url_config}[configuration guide].
