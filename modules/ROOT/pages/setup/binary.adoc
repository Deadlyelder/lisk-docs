# From other terminal
lisk-core node:info
----

//For further information and how to administer your Lisk node, please see the xref:{url_admin_binary}[Application commands] page.

//If you are not running Lisk locally, you will need to follow the xref:{url_config_api_access}[Control API access] guide to enable access.

//If all of the above steps have been successfully completed, then the next step is to move on to the configuration documentation.
//If you wish to enable forging or SSL, please see xref:{url_config}[General Configuration].

== Post-installation (optional)

* It is recommended to set up a xref:{url_config_logrotation}[log rotation]
